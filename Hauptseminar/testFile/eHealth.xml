        <ab>Even if the foundation in the field of eHealth was set almost half century ago, the current achievements' status does not place Romania on a good position in a European ranking. The efforts made during the last years are promising, but they still cannot surpass the enormous gaps in many eHealth indicators. This is not a surprising fact because the eHealth level must be sustained by a healthy and stable sanitary system and infrastructure, which, in our country, is almost in collapse, especially now in the context of global economic and financial crisis. We consider being guilty for these circumstances the lack of a clear and solid mid-term strategy developed at the level of the Ministry of Health (MoH), harmonized in a global legal and regulatory framework as well, and also the non-correlated researcher groups interests. The good attitude of practitioners regarding the challenges of new technologies and the political will can still give a chance to the Romanian healthcare system and to its modern faces.</ab>

        <ab>Technology mediated healthcare services designed to stimulate patients' self-efficacy are widely regarded as a promising paradigm to reduce the burden on the healthcare system. The promotion of healthy, active living is a topic of growing interest in research and business. Recent advances in wireless sensor technology and the widespread availability of smartphones have made it possible to monitor and coach users continuously during daily life activities. Physical activity monitoring systems are frequently designed for use over long periods of time placing usability, acceptance and effectiveness in terms of compliance high on the list of design priorities to achieve sustainable behavioral change. Tailoring, or the process of adjusting the system's behavior to individuals in a specific context, is an emerging topic of interest within the field. In this article we report a survey of tailoring techniques currently employed in state of the art real time physical activity coaching systems. We present a survey of state of the art activity coaching systems as well as a conceptual framework which identifies seven important tailoring concepts that are currently in use and how they relate to each other. A detailed analysis of current use of tailoring techniques in real time physical activity coaching applications is presented. According to the literature, tailoring is currently used only sparsely in this field. We underline the need to increase adoption of tailoring methods that are based on available theories, and call for innovative evaluation methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of individual tailoring approaches.</ab>

        <ab>eHealth is the transfer of health resources and health care by electronic means, and is enabled by communications technology through extensive information sharing and collaboration. Given the sensitive nature of medical information, and healthcare professionals' high degree of dependence on reliable records, issues of integrity, security, privacy, and confidentiality are of particular significance, and thus security must be clearly and effectively addressed by eHealth applications. This letter highlights the challenges, drivers, and standardization initiatives for security, compliance, and interoperability in health-related activities carried out over distance by means of information communication technologies. © 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: As the number of telemedicine programs continues to grow, the accuracy of diagnosis over interactive televideo is a central concern. Although investigators have begun to address diagnostic equivalency in telehealth clinics, few published studies reflect strong research design. The two presented telehealth programs completed randomized controlled trials in real-world clinical settings that addressed some of the methodologic shortcomings of prior studies. Diagnostic equivalency studies were completed across five telehealth specialty clinics: physical therapy, speech therapy, ambulatory pediatrics, child psychiatry, and developmental disabilities services. The two research teams encountered similar decision points in designing and implementing the equivalency protocols. This article addresses methodologic issues in choosing design, participants, technology, and evaluation measures. Although the paper focuses on interactive televideo, the issues raised are pertinent across telehealth technologies.</ab>

        <ab>eHealth is characterized by technology-enabled processes, systems, and applications that expedite accurate, real-time health information, feedback, and skill development to advance patient-centered care. When designed and applied in a culturally competent manner, eHealth tools can be particularly beneficial for traditionally marginalized ethnic minority groups, such as Latinos, a group that has been identified as being at the forefront of emerging technology use in the United States. In this analytic overview, we describe current eHealth research that has been conducted with Latino patient populations. In addition, we highlight cultural and linguistic factors that should be considered during the design and implementation of eHealth interventions with this population. With increasing disparities in preventive care information, behaviors, and services, as well as health care access in general, culturally competent eHealth tools hold great promise to help narrow this gap and empower communities.</ab>

        <ab>The use of telemedicine to improve patients' health has been evolving rapidly over the past few years. Initially, our clinical research focus was on the development of effective ways for treating chronically ill patients, mostly those suffering from neurological disorders. While we identified the medical benefits of this information technology, there remains a salient strategic question addressing its competitive impact. In this paper, we analyze the impact of introducing telemedicine on the market share of the specialty hospital deploying this technology and on the competing hospitals in the region. Our analytical results prove that, contrary to earlier expectations, the value of telemedicine relative to in-person visits is not always increasing with the distance of the patient from the hospital. This result explains why patients located far from the specialty hospital may not prefer telemedicine care. We prove that telemedicine, unlike numerous other e-commerce applications, does not lead to the "winner takes all" phenomenon. We found that the advent of telemedicine changes the competitive equilibrium between specialty hospitals and community hospitals. Both hospital types will significantly benefit from delivering complementary care to chronic patients, rather than continuing to compete with each other.</ab>

        <ab>The author comments on the Portoroz Declaration enacted by the European Union that attempts to address issues related to the support of "eHealth" or "telemedicine." It is argued that the scale of existing delivery of ehealth-care is under-recognized. Figures showing a significant increase in the number of prescriptions made via the Internet, as well as a rise in teleophthalmology, teledermatology, and telepathology across Europe are cited. The steps needed to assure the safety of European patients accessing telemedicine are enumerated.</ab>

        <ab>Mobile Cloud Computing is a significant technology which combines emerging domains such as mobile computing and cloud computing which has conducted to the development of one of the most IT industry challenging and innovative trend. This is still at the early stage of development but its main characteristics, advantages and range of services which are provided by an internet-based cluster system have a strong impact on the process of developing telemedicine solutions for overcoming the wide challenges the medical system is confronting with. Mobile Cloud integrates cloud computing into the mobile environment and has the advantage of overcoming obstacles related to performance (e.g. battery life, storage, and bandwidth), environment (e.g. heterogeneity, scalability, availability) and security (e.g. reliability and privacy) which are commonly present at mobile computing level. In this paper, I will present a comprehensive overview on mobile cloud computing including definitions, services and the use of this technology for developing telemedicine application.</ab>

        <ab>The American Society for Bioethics and Humanities promulgated standards for clinical ethics consultants and is currently developing a national Quality Attestation in Clinical Ethics Consultation to assist facilities in ensuring that those performing clinical ethics consultations meet minimum standards. As the field moves towards such professionalization, there is a need to provide access to qualified clinical ethicists at a broad range of medical facilities. Currently, however, there are insufficient numbers of trained clinical ethicists to staff all healthcare facilities, and many facilities lack the necessary resources to hire staff clinical ethicists. In this review, we describe several models for providing expert clinical ethics support to remote facilities that lack access to qualified clinical ethicists. Based on this analysis, we recommend telemedicine as the optimal model providing expert support to local ethics committee members tasked with providing clinical ethics consultation services.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Examine use of the Internet (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) technologies by privately insured, publicly insured (Medicare/ Medicaid), or uninsured U.S. adults in 2012. Data Source: Pew Charitable Trust telephone interviews of a nationally representative, random sample of 3,014 adult U.S. residents, age 18+. Methods: Estimate health information seeking behavior overall and by segment (i.e., insurance type), then, adjust estimates for individual traits, clinical need, and technology access using logistic regression. Results: Most respondents prefer offline to online (Internet) health information sources; over half across all segments use the Internet. More respondents communicate with providers offline compared with online. Most self-reported Internet users use online tools for health information, with privately insured respondents more likely to use new technologies. Unadjusted use rates differ across segments. Medicaid beneficiaries are more likely than the privately insured to share health information online, and Medicare beneficiaries are more likely than the privately insured to text with health professionals. After adjustment, these differences were minimal (e.g., Medicare beneficiaries had odds similar to the privately insured of online physician consultations), or the direction of the association reversed (e.g., Medicaid beneficiaries had greater odds than the privately insured of online physician consultations versus lower odds before adjustment). Discussion: Few adults report eHealth or mHealth use in 2012. Use levels appear unevenly distributed across insurance types, which could be mostly attributed to differences in individual traits and/or need. As out-of-pocket costs of medical care increases, consumers may increasingly turn to these generally free electronic health tools.</ab>

        <ab>Telemedicine programs within health care are experiencing significant growth as healthcare organizations seek to reduce expenditures and improve efficiency. The high costs of treating chronic diseases, compounded by an aging population, has given focus to creating technology-enabled alternatives to support, enhance, or expand patient services. As investments in telemedicine products and services grow at a rapid pace, user technology acceptance has become a key issue in successful implementation. Drawing from the Unified Theory of Acceptance in Technology (UTAUT), this study investigated the predictors of behavioral intention to use Telehealth equipment by patients, clinicians, and agency personnel at Henry Ford e-Home Health Care. Survey data were provided by 126 participants recruited from an eligible population who were either currently using the Telehealth equipment or were familiar with it. Structural equation modeling was used to study the overall fit of the UTAUT model in predicting behavioral intention. Participant type, self-efficacy, anxiety and attitude were tested as moderators. Implications for increasing adoption of Telehealth technology are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Software platforms focused on the healthcare monitoring sector have recently attained a great penetration in the ICT market and they certainly constitute a key contributor to the improvement of the elderly people’s quality of life and the reduction of healthcare costs. It is of great importance that the platform allows for the simultaneous health, mental and psychological status evaluation of an elderly person. However, the integration of vital signs monitoring (Telehealth) with behavioral analysis based on home care sensors (Telecare) has not yet been established at a large scale. We describe the design and implementation of such platform that enables the deployment of services to follow-up the patient’s health status based on a set of monitored parameters per disease and to profile user’s habits and diagnose deviations from their usual activities. A key aspect of the platform is its Service Oriented Architecture middleware that collects data from heterogeneous Telecare and Telehealth gateways and provides the upper service layers with a unified and standards compliant message. In this way, an integrated view of Telehealth and Telecare data and alerts is made possible into a backend Web Portal where clinicians and operators have access to.</ab>

        <ab>The medical system is facing a wide range of challenges nowadays due to changes that are taking place in the global healthcare systems. These challenges are represented mostly by economic constraints (spiraling costs, financial issues), but also, by the increased emphasis on accountability and transparency, changes that were made in the education field, the fact that the biomedical research keeps growing in what concerns the complexities of the specific studies etc. Also the new partnerships that were made in medical care systems and the great advances in IT industry suggest that a predominant paradigm shift is occurring. This needs a focus on interaction, collaboration and increased sharing of information and knowledge, all of these may is in turn be leading healthcare organizations to embrace the techniques of data mining in order to create and sustain optimal healthcare outcomes. Data mining is a domain of great importance nowadays as it provides advanced data analysis techniques for extracting the knowledge from the huge volumes of data collected and stored by every system of a daily basis. In the healthcare organizations data mining can provide valuable information for pa-tient's diagnosis and treatment planning, customer relationship management, organization resources management or fraud detection. In this article we focus on describing the im-portance of data mining techniques and systems for healthcare organizations with a focus on developing and implementing telemedicine solution in order to improve the healthcare ser-vices provided to the patients. We provide architecture for integrating data mining techniques into telemedicine systems and also offer an overview on understanding and improving the im-plemented solution by using Business Process Management methods.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Evaluate the growth in various types of Medicare-paid telehealth services. Background: There has been a long-standing hope that telehealth could be used to reduce rural patients’ travel times to specialty physicians. Medicare covers telehealth services provided through live, interactive videoconferencing between a beneficiary located at a certified rural site and a distant practitioner. Methods: We analyzed 100% of telehealth Medicare claims for 2009 matched to individual patient ZIP codes and individual provider characteristics. Results: Despite increases in Medicare payment rates for telehealth services, expansions of covered services, reductions in provider requirements, and provisions of federal grants to encourage telehealth, growth in adoption of telehealth among providers has been modest. Medicare claims indicate that only 369 providers had 10 or more Medicare telehealth consultations in 2009. Roughly half of the 369 were mental health professionals, and about one-in-five of the 369 were non-physician professionals (e.g., physician assistants and nurse practitioners). On balance, the strong areas of telehealth are mental health and, surprisingly, nonphysician professionals. The comparative advantage of mental health could be the verbal (rather than physical contact) nature of mental health care, and the comparative advantage of non-physician professionals could be their lower labor costs.</ab>

        <ab>The use of telemedicine, especially as it is relates to telestroke, has significantly expanded over the past one or two decades. The fact that stroke therapy is a time-critical disease process, coupled with the relative paucity of stroke-trained practitioners, makes telestroke an attractive technique of care. The authors’ objective was to summarize the evidence that support the reliability of telemedicine for diagnosis and efficacy in acute stroke treatment in collaboration between hospitals in two different countries.</ab>

        <ab>Substance use and mental health problems are often underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary care. Veterans affairs facilities are using the Behavioral Telehealth Center (BTC) to provide evidence-based assessments for primary care patients via telephone. Whether participation in BTC services is associated with (1) increases in healthcare utilization and (2) decreases in symptoms based on behavioral health screening instruments, post-BTC services compared with pre-BTC services were investigated. Retrospective data were extracted for 1,820 patients who were referred to the BTC. Differences in utilization rates and symptom scores pre- and post-BTC services were tested using repeated measures analysis of covariance while controlling for relevant sociodemographic variables. Participants (1) utilized significantly more substance use and mental health treatment services and (2) had significantly lower alcohol and depression screening scores post-BTC services compared with pre-BTC services. This initial evaluation provides support that BTC services are associated with increased healthcare utilization and decreased alcohol and depressive symptoms.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents a model and two scenarios that have been developed to assist decision makers in planning for the impact of telemedicine in both developed, and developing nations. A vision of ubiquitous access to health-monitoring and healthcare is explored and emerging approaches described, however there remain many formidable obstacles to the realization of telemedicine; some are technological, others relate to the development of international standards for medical record systems, and other challenges are related to human acceptance, as well as the development of appropriate and compelling business value chains.</ab>

        <ab>Population aging, life expectancy and even economic inequality and health inequality have become a serious problem in Taiwan. There are two main issues here: one is dramatic change of family structure, the other is health care for the elderly. On one hand, it is a social problem. On the other hand, this also results in a potential opportunity for providing medical business for the elderly or weak minority in term of social welfare as well as business model. Due to long life expectancy, low fertility, the population of elder above 65 years old is over 11% in Taiwan. This figure will shoot up to 14% in 6 years and up to 20% in 2025. Therefore, the potential business to provide elderly people with health, residence, economy, social adaptation and leisure such as senior center, catering service, day care or medical service is demanding and promising. In addition, the Taiwanese aborigine tribe is the minority which is about 2% of total population of Taiwan. The aborigines inhabit the eastern half of Taiwan which consists mostly of mountainous terrain with weak economic conditions. Most of them have a lower life expectancy and need government supports, especially for health care. This study will investigate the area of Hualien, located in eastern part of Taiwan, where the most aborigine tribe lives in mountain area with poor transportation facility. In addition, the medical institutions are less equipped in most area except downtown. In this case, it is good to design a telehealth care model for this area. If the model works, then it will be easily applied to other area with better condition. This study will use data-mining to get the demographic data and medication record from patients in Hualien. It is essential to get the support from Hualien Hospital. The feedback and communication between hospital and subject sample or even patient is also critical to make this model effective. All the health care data about target sample will convey to hospital through cloud computing. The hospital will give comments about medication after a careful analysis. An initial investment is required to set up a basic instrument at home for each sample flame. A clear presentation or demonstration is also needed to make all health measurement right on track.</ab>

        <ab>This article reports on ethnographic research into the practical and ethical consequences of the implementation and use of telecare devices for older people living at home in Spain and the United Kingdom. Telecare services are said to allow the maintenance of their users’ autonomy through connectedness, relieving the isolation from which many older people suffer amid rising demands for care. However, engaging with Science and Technology Studies (STS) literature on “user configuration” and implementation processes, we argue here that neither services nor users preexist the installation of the service: they are better described as produced along with it. Moving beyond design and appropriation practices, our contribution stresses the importance of installations as specific moments where such emplacements take place. Using Etienne Souriau’s concept of instauration, we describe the ways in which, through installation work, telecare services “bring into existence” their very infrastructure of usership. Hence, both services and telecare users are effects of fulfilling the “felicity conditions” (technical, relational, and contractual) of an achieved installation.</ab>

        <ab>Globalization has resulted in free flow of goods and services and transfer of technology across borders. With technology advancement and IT revolution in this new regime the healthcare sector has undergone a radical change. IT based healthcare services and related IT services arising out of healthcare delivery system has reached new heights. With high technology oriented satellite services provided by ISRO and medical expertise supplied mostly by the newly emerged super-specialty hospitals, telemedicine services are not only getting exported abroad but reaching remote corners of the country as well through public-private-partnerships. These are paving the path for sophisticated ambulatory services, new generation diagnostics and pathological services and remote robotic surgeries making India a healthcare hub of South Asian region. The estimated net benefit from the spread of telemedicine in India may exceed 1.5 per cent of her GDP. This technological breakthrough has its presence in back-office management of healthcare related services like (a) medical billing coding etc., (b) claims processing and (c) clinical trials and contract manufacturing. Sources of vulnerabilities arise for the sector with more market orientation and weak regulatory framework. Gradual conversion of a merit good into a market good calls for greater regulatory vigilance.</ab>

        <ab>Virtual expertise is a critical component of telehealth projects and it needs to be effectively managed if telehealth is to deliver on its potential. There are many issues within telehealth that relate to the management of knowledge, and we identify and classify these using a range of papers on the topic. We introduce a virtual expertise platform that provides basic building blocks for effect-leveraging of expertise in this domain. The platform includes management directives and goals, a collaborative culture, an appropriate information and communication technology platform, a knowledge management layer, and a tools or application layer that interact to facilitate knowledge sharing, and ultimately improve patient care. We also emphasize how social media tools can be used as part of the tools layer to improve virtual knowledge sharing before and after telehealth events.</ab>

        <ab>This article is based on the introduction of a telemedicine system in the jungles of northeastern Peru. The system was designed by a European consortium led by a Spanish polytechnic in cooperation with two universities in Lima and the Peruvian Ministry of Health. The purpose of the system was to improve health conditions by extending science-based medicine into a region with well-established traditional  healing practices. The central analytical focus of this article is on the interplay between the public health care system, which used the telemedicine system, and local health care practices. The manner in which scientific medicine was delivered through information technology and public health care services is analyzed in terms of the health personnel's activity, the local population's conceptions of health, and the trajectories followed by patients seeking recovery. The author participated in the design of the second evaluation of the telemedicine system and acted as a participant observer in the regional hospital and peripheral clinics. In addition to interviewing health care staff from the study area, the author also met with traditional healers, and patients in the districts whether of not they were involved in the telemedicine project. New institutional theory provided the analytical framework for the interpretation of the observed behavior of the public health care staff, traditional healers, and potential patients.  Empirically, this study describes the informal aspects of the functioning of the telemedicine system, and its partial mismatch with the definitions of health and illness employed by local communities and healers.  An argument is made that people's construction of  their health, which is embedded in their normal patterns of action, should be identified, and then considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of future telemedicine projects.  This article problematizes an approach to telemedicine-based health development that is weakly...</ab>

        <ab>Healthcare delivery in many developing countries is seriously troubled. In this paper we discuss the strategic design of a project to radically redesign the delivery of healthcare in Cameroon. Specifically, the goal of this project is to change the way that healthcare is delivered in Cameroon and thereby move the country closer to its long-range developmental goals for maternal and child health. The project will deliver prenatal care, postnatal care, well baby visits, vaccinations, HIV/AIDS testing, and cervical cancer screening directly to the village level using a vehicle equipped as a mobile hospital and connected to tertiary care facilities and subspecialty physicians in Yaoundé using telemedicine technology. The project will also improve the capacity of the healthcare system by delivering training and education to healthcare workers in district hospitals via telemedicine technology. It is our hope that this model can be used to guide healthcare delivery in developing countries worldwid</ab>

        <ab>This story is one of many successful experiences in the adoption of telemedicine in Africa. Telemedicine refers to health care delivery where physicians examine distant patients using telecommunications technologies as simple as telephones and fax machines or as complex as PCs and interactive multimedia applications. The delivery of health care using telemedicine has been reported in previous research at an individual level and at a national level of analysis. Health care is one of the most fundamental needs for sub-Saharan Africa, considering the region's multiple medical problems. Another major problem faced by sub-Saharan African countries is the shortage of medical personnel. The region averages fewer than 10 doctors per 100,000 people, and 14 countries within the region do not have a single radiologist. The specialists and services available are concentrated in cities. In a bid to find a solution to the growing medical problems for this region, many governmental, non-governmental, and international developmental organizations have engaged in an endless effort to implement telemedicine.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper we analyse the efficiency of Telecare service management for dependent people over 65 years old. Accordingly, we estimate the costs which optimize the operation of the Telecare service, based on a Queuing Theory model. The methodological application is carried out using the Telecare service in Castilla y León as study case, given that it is one of the Spanish regions with higher rate of demographic aging. In order to measure the impact of demographic ageing on the Telecare service demand, we consider the INE population projections adjusted for dependent elderly population to the time period 2005-2015.</ab>
        <ab>En este trabajo se analiza la eficiencia en la provisión del servicio de Teleasistencia para las personas dependientes de 65 y más años. Para ello, se han estimado los costes que optimizan su funcionamiento según un modelo de Teoría de Colas. La aplicación de esta metodología se lleva a cabo tomando como caso de estudio el servicio de Teleasistencia en Castilla y León, por ser ésta una de las regiones españolas con mayor tasa de envejecimiento demográfico. Para evaluar el impacto del envejecimiento demográfico sobre la demanda del servicio de Teleasistencia, se utilizan las proyecciones de población del INE ajustadas a la población anciana dependiente para el período 2005-2015.</ab>

CMS allows distant-site hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) to enforce proxy credentialing with Medicare-certified hospitals and telemedicine entities. CMS has elucidated that it is the obligation of the medicine-precipitation site to determine that the specifics of the requirements are presented before entering an arrangement.</ab>

        <ab>The study uses data from a study of telemedicine in two rural, Ohio (United States) counties to test predictions about individuals' stated intent to receive medical care through videoconferencing. The authors follow communication scholars in predicting that the perceived attributes of a new technology will significantly affect willingness to try the technology. They draw on the work of marketing scholars to argue that task situations (e.g., routine, emergency, and specialist medical care) will affect the relative importance of the perceived attributes. Results supported both predictions. The authors believe that the results have practical value for those seeking to encourage the use of telemedicine and, furthermore, that the results have both theoretical and practical implications for business communication scholars and professionals.</ab>

        <ab>Telemedicine involves the use of advanced telecommunications technologies to exchange medical information allowing for the provision of health care services across geographic, temporal, social and cultural barriers. This article describes the results of a study that uses a framework to examine the technology implementation of a Hong Kong-based telemedicine program. Supported by image transmission and display systems, neurosurgeons at an acute tertiary hospital can provide remote consultation and patient assessment and management services to attending physicians at a regional general hospital. Regular use of the system, although intermittent, became part of the surgeons' routine clinical activities. Overall, surgeons were familiar with the current system's operations and did not find its use difficult. Telemedicine represents a promising and exciting technology-enabled solution for long-standing problems in health care, including service accessibility, quality, costs and resource allocation. The ultimate success of telemedicine as a viable service delivery and collaboration alternative requires that health care organizations properly address technological and managerial challenges.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on practicalities of telemedicine as a viable method of health-care delivery. Telemedicine can be broadly defined as the use of telecommunications technologies to provide medical information and services. It involves the practice of delivering health care over a distance using telecommunications equipment such as telephones, fax machines, personal computers and full-motion interactive multimedia. Telemedicine consists of both real-time interactive consults as well as batch processing of patient data and information for diagnosis at a later time. With the anticipated use of managed-care incentives to provide accessible, low-cost health care, the health-care industry is forced to look at alternative methods for providing services. Telemedicine has a number of challenges to overcome before it can be integrated into the overall fabric of health care. Cost might be the single largest nontechnical issue to be addressed. To be fully integrated at its highest level, telemedicine will also require the filly functioning conversion of the standard paper-based medical record into an electronic format, an area wrought with its own set of challenges.</ab>

        <ab>We empirically investigate the relationship between information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the delivery of country-level public health. Our underlying hypothesis is that ICTs can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public health delivery mechanisms. In our framework, we include the ICT factors of accessibility, quality, affordability, applications, and institutional efficiency and sustainability. The public health delivery is represented by the changes in the indicators of immunization coverage, TB infection, sanitation, undernourishment, life expectancy, mortality rate, and health care expenses. Results indicate in most cases ICT factors have a significant correlation to a country's delivery of public health over and above a country's income level. The 'Accessibility' ICT factor contributes to improved delivery for nearly all of the public health indicators. This is followed by 'ICT Applications.' Increased ICTs usage leads to increased health care expenditure. Our findings are useful at the country level for informing policy decisions regarding the nature and extent of investment in ICT infrastructure for the delivery of public health. We do caution that merely investing in more ICTs does not imply an automatic improvement in public health. Rather, ICTs have the potential to improve the delivery process.</ab>

        <ab>The paper makes a case for the use of sociology of translation as a way of integrating the classical rational and stepwise view of innovation, showcasing its capacity to produce accounts of innovation that are process oriented, sensitive to contextual conditions, and attentive to its political, conflictual and institutional aspects. It does so by utilizing the approach to study the establishment and mainstreaming of cardiac telecare in northern Italy. Building on the results of a three-year longitudinal study, the paper describes the process through which this innovative approach carved a space within the existing texture of medical practices by enrolling in successive waves a range of allies and support. The detailed narration brings to the fore some crucial aspects of the local processes of negotiation and struggle and, more generally, the work and effort that goes into the making of any innovation. The paper concludes that this way of studying and narrating innovation is particularly capable of bringing back time, effort and politics into the account of the innovation process.</ab>

        <ab>Telecare is the use of information and communication systems to facilitate care delivery to individuals in their homes. Although the expectations of telecare are high, its implementation has proved complex. This case study demonstrates this complexity through a structurational analysis of a telecare implementation process. The paper shows how structuration concepts enable a combined analysis of actors' interactions with a technology and of the interaction among these actors from different institutional contexts. In this example, fragmented multi-actor agency induced an inconsistent implementation mode, leading to unsuccessful telecare appropriation. This paper concludes with a preliminary proposal for more consistent telecare implementation modes. These modes may better support the actors' reflexive monitoring and dialogue and inform further research.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on HealthPresence, a telecommunication in medicine system created by the high technology industry company Cisco Systems. The system employs videoconferencing and telecommunication transmission of medical examination data gathered by a nurse to physicians allowing them to diagnose and treat patients without meeting the patient in person. The impact of such systems on the delivery of medical care, particularly to patients in areas which have few physicians offering specialized care, is discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Compression of Electrocardiographic (ECG) data is an important requirement to develop an efficient telecardiology application. This study describes an offline compression technique, which is implemented for ECG transmission in a global system of mobile (GSM) network for preliminary level evaluation of patient's cardiac condition in a non-critical condition. A short-duration (5-6 beats) ECG data from Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database is used for the trial. The compression algorithm is based on direct processing of ECG samples in four major steps: viz., down-sampling of dataset, normalising inter-sample differences, grouping for sign and magnitude encoding, zero element compression and finally, conversion of bytes into corresponding 8 bit American standard code for information interchange (ASCII) characters. The developed software at the patient side computer also converts the compressed data file into formatted sequence of short text messages (SMSs). Using a dedicated GSM module these message are delivered to the mobile phone of the remote cardiologist. The received SMSs are to be downloaded at the authors computer for concatenation and decompression to obtain back the original ECG for visual or automated investigation. An average percentage root-mean- squared difference and compression ratio values of 43.54 and 1.73 are obtained, respectively, with MIT-BIH arrhythmia data. The proposed technique is useful for rural clinics in India for preliminary level cardiac investigation.</ab>

        <ab>The integration of heterogeneous wireless technologies is believed to aid revolutionary healthcare delivery in hospitals and residential care. Wireless medical device coexistence is a growing concern given the ubiquity of wireless technology. In spite of this, a consensus standard that addresses risks associated with wireless heterogeneous networks has not been adopted. This paper serves as a starting point by recommending a practice for assessing the coexistence of a wireless medical device in a non-line-of-sight environment utilizing 802.15.4 in a practical, versatile, and reproducible test setup. This paper provides an extensive survey of other coexistence studies concerning 802.15.4 and 802.11 and reports on the authors’ coexistence testing inside and outside an anechoic chamber. Results are compared against a non-line-of-sight test setup. Findings relative to co-channel and adjacent channel interference were consistent with results reported in the literature.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents theoretical comments on the theme of ‘media ubiquity’, as an introduction to the presentation of an information and communication technology ‘4’ development (ICT4D)project in the Republic of Somaliland: The Somaliland Telemedical System for Psychiatry. This project is based on use of resources of the global civil society emerging in global ‘transformations’ related to migration, media and ‘the social work of the imagination’. Whereas much new media debate departs from the assumption of media ubiquity affecting our notions of reality, the article will attempt a different perspective. It will ponder issues of collective imagination as exerted by way of such effects, i.e. in cultural forms that emerge out of media-roles in the ‘complex connectivity’ in globalisation processes.</ab>

        <ab>We reflect on the experiences of OLDES (Older People@Home), a European Commission 6th Framework-co-funded project, which sought to undertake a user-centred design of telecare services for older people. A series of interventions were undertaken with the objective of nurturing co-production. The aim was a rebalancing of the techno-centric focus of the system development and delivery partners in the project in order to address the wider needs and interests of other members and stakeholders (in particular, health, social care and the voluntary/community sector) as well as those of the older people themselves and their carers. The intention, in response to the challenges posed by an ageing demographic, was to effect wider discussions about the role of a telecare in the sustainable development of health and social care services. We use this experience to reflect on the practical struggles involved in trying to build a shared set of understandings and practices that might enable a variant of co-production to be nurtured and to evolve. We conclude by discussing the challenges of being engaged in this sort of process and the need to include spaces and occasions for the innovation of inter-organisational relationships as an essential part of the shaping of complex products and services of this type.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Recent studies conclude that patient survival during a health emergency situation depends on the effective pre-hospital healthcare. Mobile telemedicine exploits different wireless network technologies in order to tackle this problem. This paper looks into the case of mobile telemedicine service provision in a moving vehicle (ambulance). The special characteristics and requirements of this operational scenario are discussed in terms of benefits and limitations in conjunction with the application of existing wireless communication systems in this case. Moreover, emerging wireless broadband communication systems and spectrum access technology are considered in the same context, in an attempt to further improve service provision and face future challenges.</ab>

        <ab>Manifestations of e-governance in modern society are numerous and its importance is hard to overestimate. I have just returned from a press trip to France, where we were introduced to the country's achievements in the area of e-health, a rather broad concept that involves technological innovation, telemedicine, online access to medical records and drugs prescriptions and so on. In the Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris, we were shown an impressive Telegeria network, coordinated by Dr Pierre Espinoza and Alexis Westermann, President of Bluelinea, a company specialising in home care of vulnerable patients. This network connects leading hospitals in different parts of the country and allows them to hold high-quality and high-definition video-consultations between leading specialists and patients staying either at home or at specialised care wards hundreds of miles away.</ab>

        <ab>Today various real-time services, such as audio and video conferencing and telemedicine are being deployed over the Internet. This requires the network to provide guarantees of the service provided to the receiver. The needs of applications are specified in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as the desired bandwidth, response time, loss rate, expected reliability, etc. Support for QoS must be provided at each of the layers of the protocol stack for overall efficiency in network utilization. Routing algorithms supporting QoS differentiation differ from traditional routing algorithms in that, in QoS routing, the path from the source to the destination must satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously, while in conventional routing, routing decisions are made only on a single metric, such as cost or delay. However, it is well known that the problem of path selection subject to two or more independent additive metrics is NP-complete which means that there is no efficient (polynomial) exact solution for the general multi-constrained path (MCP) selection problems. In this paper, we present an outline of distributed QoS routing problems and propose a mean field annealing (MFA) heuristic algorithm to solve the MCP problem. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        <ab>In this paper, we introduce an interactive telecommunication system that supports video/audio signal acquisition, data processing, transmission, and 3D animation for post stroke rehabilitation. It is designed for stroke patients to use in their homes. It records motion exercise data, and immediately transfers this data to hospitals via the internet. A real-time videoconferencing interface is adopted for patients to observe therapy instructions from therapists. The system uses a peer-to-peer network architecture, without the need for a server. This is a potentially effective approach to reducing costs, allowing easy setup and permitting group-rehabilitation sessions. We evaluate this system using the following steps: (1) motion detection in different movement patterns, such as reach, drink, and reach-flexion; (2) online bidirectional visual telecommunication; and (3) 3D rendering using a proposed offline animation package. This evaluation has subjectively been proved to be optimal.</ab>

        <ab>Dominant discourses on telecare technologies often celebrate the erasure of distance and place. This paper provides a critical intervention into these discourses by investigating how spaces still matter, despite the move from physical to virtual encounters between healthcare professionals and patients. I argue that science and technology studies (STS) research on telecare, as well as other technologies, can be enriched by including a focus on place to understand the dynamic interactions between people and things. Adopting insights of human geographers, I show how places in which technologies are used affect how technologies enable or constrain human actions and identities. Whereas some spaces may facilitate the incorporation of technologies, others may resist technologies. A focus on how places matter is important for understanding how telecare technologies reorder and redefine healthcare. Although other healthcare technologies are also important actors in transforming healthcare, telecare technologies do this in a very specific way: they redefine the spatial dimensions of healthcare. To capture and further explore this changing spatial configuration of healthcare, I introduce the notion of technogeography of care. This concept provides a useful heuristic to study how places matter in healthcare. Although telecare technologies introduce virtual encounters between healthcare providers and patients, the use of telecare devices still largely depends on locally grounded, situated care acts. Based on interviews with users of several cardiac telecare applications, including healthcare professionals and patients in Germany and the Netherlands, the paper shows how patients’ homes and public spaces are important for shaping the implementation and use of telecare technologies, and vice versa. Last, but not least, telecare devices are implicated as well. The paper emphasizes the place-dependency of the use and meaning of technical devices by showing how the same technological device can do and mean different things in different places.</ab>

        <ab>As consumers improve their eHealth literacy skills, their trust in commercial Web sites - even ones that provide reliable information - might decrease. Informed by the persuasion knowledge model, this study examined how much adolescents trusted and relied on commercial and brand Web sites as a source of health information. Both before and after an eHealth literacy intervention among 182 middle-schoolers, students perceived commercial and brand Web sites to be the least reliable and trustworthy sources of health information. Practical and managerial implications are discussed regarding advertisers' efforts in the age of new media to uphold social responsibility and regain consumer trust.</ab>

        <ab>eHealth services are experiencing a slow diffusion in developing countries. Yet, despite the managerial importance of such a question, little research considers e-health and its adoption. This article therefore investigates this topic and aims at better understanding what are the motivational factors influencing medical professionals intention to use eHealth services. Literature on Technology Acceptance Models was first investigated and adapted to the research context with the help of a qualitative study. Then a quantitative study was performed. Data from 10 developing countries revealed atypical findings. Performance expectancy, social influence through moderators, government policy, medical education, and medical knowledge contribute to the intention to use eHealth services in developing countries. Analytical results indicate the importance of government attitude in the adoption of these innovative services. Geographic differences between urban and rural areas also revealed the need for different marketing strategies for these environments. The results of the research were two-fold. First, unique, new constructs based on The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model to measure behavioural intention by medical professionals in developing countries were developed. Second, a model which details relationships between motivational factors and behavioural intention was proposed and validated based on the specific domain of eHealth services. The findings of the study have valuable implications for both academic and management practice in the field of international marketing management.</ab>

        <ab>Internet usage has been steadily increasing over recent years, and people have become used to manage the medical aspects of their lives using the Internet. Meanwhile, many organizational changes are influencing the provision of healthcare. This raises the question whether the demands of healthcare patients match the current online healthcare (or: eHealth) interventions, and which interventions are the most interesting. In order to explore the attitude of citizens/patients for (new) eHealth services an adapted version of the technology acceptance model is developed and tested, using a survey held among health consumers in private healthcare organizations. The results of this survey showed that services like online prescription refills and online appointments are deemed useful. Also, patients are in need for quality information regarding health issues. This indicates that patients are ready for the adoption of eHealth services, but providers of such services should make sure that it is easy to use and that using it has a clear advantage.</ab>

        <ab>Delivery of healthcare services presents many challenges for governments in most developing countries. Some of these challenges include financial and human resources issues that might affect governments' ability to manage and transform scarce resources to meet healthcare needs. Telemedicine, a healthcare delivery technology where physicians examine patients from distant locations using information technologies, is reported to be increasingly helpful in meeting the needs of the healthcare sector in developing nations such as those in sub-Saharan Africa. This conceptual study reports on the sectoral adoption of telemedicine in Ethiopia, a sub-Saharan African country. We examine the potential benefits of telemedicine diffusion in Ethiopia, addressing the country's healthcare needs, and discussing the obstacles and challenges. Based on previous literature, as well as experiences drawn from other developing nations, we address three potential factors that could influence the diffusion of telemedicine in Ethiopia: active participation of institutions of higher education, Ethiopian foreign alliances, and government involvement. Although the initial successes are relatively small and involve isolated projects, they have been promising and have set the stage for researchers to investigate prevailing projects so as to gain better understanding of the aforementioned factors. Our study does not claim that telemedicine can solve all of Ethiopia's medical challenges; however, we contend that it is a starting point to reach Africans that live in areas with limited medical facilities and personnel. Hence, our study could have far reaching implications as the world looks to help this country, and by extension, other developing countries, to overcome their medical challenges and join the information society.</ab>

        <ab>Department of Information Systems, Washington State University, Pullman, WA. E-mail: pdatta@wsu.edu The authors examine the need and adoption of teleophthalmology in sub-Saharan Africa. Ethiopia, like most sub-Saharan African countries, is faced with limited specialists and health care services. These services are often concentrated in the urban areas, leaving most of the rural population (about 70% of the country) without adequate and timely health care delivery. In Ethiopia, the ratio of ophthalmologists to the population is 1:1,200,000, resulting in inadequate delivery of ophthalmology-related health care services. Using both primary and secondary data collection approaches, the authors report the need for telemedicine as well as the adoption and application of teleophthalmology in Ethiopia. Further, they present Ethiopia's teleophthalmology network, integrated teleconsultation, and teleeducation services. The authors conclude by presenting this research as a starting point to investigate further teleophthalmology and other telemedicine services for Ethiopia and by extension, other developing countries. Therefore, they bring a much-underresearched region (sub-Saharan Africa) and a much-underresearched technology (telemedicine) to the forefront of information systems (IS) research. It is the authors' hope that colleagues in the field will be motivated to investigate this “forgotten” region of the world that is yet to reap the full potentials of information and communications technologies (ICTs).</ab>

        <ab>How do technologies such as webcams influence health care and what concepts may describe this? This article explores the literature and analyses what people looking through webcams do within a particular health care practice in the Netherlands, that is, within the rehabilitation of people suffering from severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Several ways to describe the activities webcams support and perform are identified. The webcam is (1) concentrating the activities of its users, by making them focus on the task at hand and (2) magnifies the characteristics of the already existing relationships between webcam users by imposing a relational distance that fits best with intimate contacts. (3) Although webcams shift notions of space and distance, their working appears to be related, to a great extent, to their location.</ab>

        <ab>Two different types of inverted-F antennas which can be integrated into a micro-SD (μSD) card are presented. The antennas operate in the new band from 2.4835 to 2.5 GHz dedicated to medical applications. The volume available for the antenna in the μSD card is only 11 × 3 × 1 mm3. Performance in terms of bandwidth, the radiation efficiency and the gain of the two structures is compared and discussed. The μSD card is intended to fit multiple devices with different ground plane dimensions. As an example, the influence of the μSD card position on a standard printed circuit board of 100 × 40 mm2 is also studied.</ab>

        <ab>Today, the number of elderly people and patients with reduced autonomy or with chronic diseases are steadily increasing. In addition, a stay in hospital or nursing home is very expensive. Thus, in recent years we have witnessed the development of projects to keep these people at home while providing them the needed care and assistance. The number of research projects that have emerged around the world during these last years is very important. Thus we are interested in studying a number of these projects. In this study, we focus on European projects because there is a great similarity with other projects (American, Asian and African projects). After a detailed study of various European research projects conducted in the telemonitoring of patients field, we identify the main requirements of a telemonitoring system. Then, we introduce the common components of these systems. After that, we provide a comparative study in terms of offered services, technical issues, supported functionalities and tools involved in the implementation of the proposed systems. Finally, we introduce some interesting perspectives for the patient telemonitoring research field.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the significance of medical ethics in implementing telemedicine. The author stresses that capability of telemedicine to expand accessibility and availability of healthcare to meet the specific needs of patients. He suggests that healthcare professionals must uphold their moral obligations when using such technology to achieve the quality of care. Maintaining an effective telemedicine programs can improve medical personnel-patient relationship, the author believes.</ab>

        <ab>The mobile interrupter module, dedicated to the enhanced interrupter (EIT) measurement of respiratory mechanics in a home environment and capable of cooperation with a telemedical system, is presented. Characterized by noninvasiveness and minimal requirements regarding patient cooperation, the EIT algorithm is especially suitable for newborns, preschool children, and patients suffering from respiratory muscle impairment. Furthermore, this device enables access to raw data—without initial preprocessing—in a fully flexible measurement protocol (which is not available in any commercial apparatus), and the EIT procedure improves insight (the number and precision of assessed parameters) into the physiological system with respect to the classical occlusive methods.</ab>

        <ab>This paper aims to shift the unit of analysis in the study of organisational knowledge from individuals and their actions to practices and their relationships. It introduces the concept of "site" to help advance an understanding of the relationship between practice and knowing. The notion of site supports the intuition that knowing is both sustained in practice and manifests itself through practice. It also evokes the idea of knowledge as being rooted in an extended pattern of interconnected activities that only when taken in its living and pulsating entirety constitutes the site of knowing. In this paper, Ire view the different ways to conceptualise the relationships between knowing and practice, and Isho w how the idea of site adds to the existing body of work. Building on the results of a longitudinal study in the field of telemedicine, Ithen offer suggestions on aspects of practice where knowing manifests itself, and Iuse the concepts of "translation by contact" and "at distance" to explain how dispersed knowings are woven together and the power effect that can derive from these. Iconclude by reflecting on the implications of this radical view and the direction for future research.</ab>

        <ab>Listening to patients and translating what is heard into an action plan is a mark of a successful hospital-in-the-home unit. This paper recommends eListening as the core element for hospital-in-the-home unit performance and illustrates this suggestion with an empirical study. In order to achieve this, we examine the relative importance and significance of telemedicine technologies and the level of performance related to eListening through an empirical investigation of 252 patients who belonged to a hospital-in-the-home unit (HHU) within a Spanish Regional Hospital. The results are then calculated using structural equation modelling. This leads to the main conclusion that a major hospital-in-the-home unit's ‘performance’ is unlikely to be successful without embracing eListening.</ab>

        <ab>The article examines how governmental regulation can impede the diffusion of telemedicine. The proper practice of medicine is critical to the well being of the populace. Thus, regulation of the practice of medicine has long been seen as an appropriate function of governments. Telemedicine relies on the electronic transfer of patient information from a healthcare provider to and from the location of the patient, and may involve medical diagnosis, medical treatment, and/or medical education. Telemedicine allows physicians throughout the U.S. and even the world to expand their expertise by sending and receiving electronic images and information.</ab>

        <ab>Champions are critical to the success of an information system implementation. When implementing a large information system, research shows that success may require more than one type of champion. This study investigates the types of champions used in federated inter-organizational systems (FIOS) in a state telemedicine context. Case studies were conducted in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin to identify the network of champions in state telemedicine systems. We found that FIOS that relied on a network of champions, including a sponsorship champion at the state level, as well as a technical champion and user champion at site locations, were more successful than those that lacked such a network. We suggest that our model of champions in FIOS applies not only to state telemedicine, but also to any large-scale system implementation spanning a federation of loosely coupled organizations.</ab>

        <ab>Tele-medical systems have proven to be very useful to improve patient outcomes. However, they suffered from drawbacks such as insufficient functionality, prohibitive cost, the lack of connectivity and many other factors. To solve these problems, medical experts were consulted and an embedded tele-medical system was developed that allows a doctor to analyze and predict the ailment of a patient and direct the paramedic on the scene to perform potentially life-saving corrective actions or even promote recovery. The system would capture, process and interpret ECG data from the patient using the low cost hardware which was designed.</ab>

        <ab>This paper discusses findings from four case studies of patient-present telemedicine consultation services, in which "hub" specialist physicians provide assistance to "spoke" clinicians located at a distance, using video conferencing and sometimes also electronically  exchanging other clinical information. In interviews we sought to identify why  clinicians sometimes choose not to use telemedicine consultation services. Hub  specialists (who provide the telemedicine consultation services) and doctors, nurses,  and social workers ("spoke clinicians," who receive these services) were asked to discuss their views about telemedicine systems strengths and weaknesses in the context of specific clinical episodes. For this paper we analyzed critical incident narratives to reveal insights regarding two  research questions: 1) From clinicians who sometimes use telemedicine, what can we  learn from their critical incident stories in which telemedicine was not used  yet the clinician feels it might have been helpful? What can we learn from other critical incident stories, in which telemedicine was not used?</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on various ways in which medical care can be provided through computer technology during the time of global crisis. In order to meet increasing global crises, the U.S. military must find ways to more effectively manage manpower and time. Joint Medical Operations-Telemedicine (JMO-T) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense to collect and transmit near-real-time, far-forward medical data and has been successful in resolving uncertain organizational and technological military deficiencies, improving medical communications and information management. Deployable, mobile telemedicine teams are the centerpiece of JMO-T. These teams have the capability of inserting essential networking and communications elements into austere theaters, establishing an immediate means for enhancing health protection, collaborative planning, situational awareness and strategic decision-making. JMO-T technology initiatives utilize these dedicated, small mobile teams with a sophisticated IT infrastructure to provide telemedicine capabilities where needed in the medical battlespace.</ab>

        <ab>This article examines the impact of the complementary use of telemedicine before and after a medical tour upon medical tourist satisfaction. It concludes that the integration of telemedicine technologies into the medial tourism system offer a unique opportunity for medical service providers to increase patient satisfaction and loyalty. The research establishes that remote consultations before the medical tour facilitate in generating more realistic expectations in the minds of the patients, thus minimizing the perception-expectation gap. However, this does not necessarily lead to higher levels of patient satisfaction. Likewise, remote consultations held following the medical tour assist in minimizing cognitive dissonance, redressing patient complaints, and boosting service loyalty.</ab>

        <ab>Telecardiological consultancy, enabling distant consultation between cardiologist and the general practitioner in the presence of the patient and relying on a technological infrastructure, is a new medical working practice. This article proposes a practice-based approach in order to study it as an object emerging from a local ecology of human and non-human. An analytical framework proposes three interpretative lines: a reading of practice 'from outside' (as a patterned set of activities), a reading 'from inside' (as knowing-in-practice) and a reading as a social practice (as a 'doing' of society). The article analyses the discursive practices involved in a month of telecardiological consultancies in order to understand the effects of this new practice in a Western health care context. One of these meanings is that, as telecardiology comes into use, it is inscribed more in the social practice of reassurance that in the medical one of preventing and dealing with emergencies.</ab>

        <ab>Considerable effort has been invested in telemedicine and e-health, but relatively few applications have endured beyond the research and development phase. Research within different academic disciplines points to the significance of established working and organizational relations within healthcare in shaping the outcome of particular projects, whether successful or otherwise. Even so, the findings appear as disparate and discrete observations which make it difficult for those involved in the field to get an overview of ICT in healthcare work and organization or to interpret the implications of the studies. The aim of our article is to demonstrate the importance and value of situating ICT initiatives within a sociological framework of healthcare work and organization and to show how this enables us to carry out systematic analysis across a range of ICT initiatives in different clinical settings.</ab>

        <ab>The paper presents and discusses a collaborative teleconsultation system built on next generation network (NGN) transmission considerations. Considering the capability of merging medical images with multimedia data and real‐time video conferencing in transmission provided by NGN networks, the system is built with computer‐supported cooperative work (CSCW), DICOM standard, security functions, and image processing/analysis tools. The built‐in CSCW creates a collaborative consultation environment for synchronous interactive face‐to‐face discussion. The security functions provide the privacy and integrity in patient data transmission. The DICOM standard enables the medical image access to the PACS connecting with various imaging modalities. The image processing/analysis tools supported by CSCW functions provide useful tools for physicians to examine the images, and short‐code messages are defined to transmit the image operation command for maintaining the system consistency between users. These functions are discussed and tested on the NGN network transmission for its characteristics including transmission latency, jitter, data loss rate, and multicast performance. The experiments show that adopting the short‐code message drastically reduces the bandwidth requirement and also the user waiting time, under which the basic bandwidth requirement of the system during consultation is about 160 Kbps. The security functions occupy 92 ms and 83 ms for encryption and decryption, respectively, for a 518‐Kbytes image file. The multicast transmission technology is adopted to avoid the increase of network traffic when the number of participants expands. The experiments also show that the use of tunneling slightly increases overhead; however, the system can be deployed on the network without supporting IP multicasting via tunneling.</ab>

        <ab>More than 10 years ago, Tart (1990) described virtual reality (VR) as a technological model of consciousness offering intriguing possibilities for developing diagnostic, inductive, psychotherapeutic, and training techniques that can extend and supplement current ones. To exploit and understand this potential is the overall goal of the "Telemedicine and Portable Virtual Environment in Clinical Psychology"—VEPSY UPDATED—a European Community– funded research project (IST-2000-25323, www.cybertherapy.info). Particularly, its specific goal is the development of different PC-based virtual reality modules to be used in clinical assessment and treatment of social phobia, panic disorders, male sexual disorders, obesity, and eating disorders. The paper describes the clinical and technical rationale behind the clinical applications developed by the project. Moreover, the paper focuses its analysis on the possible role of VR in clinical psychology and how it can be used for therapeutic change.</ab>

        <ab>While telemedicine's clinical effectiveness and educational benefits are accepted, its cost-effectiveness is controversial. This study focuses on telemedicine's cost-effectiveness from a provider's perspective. Reviews of the cost-effectiveness literature in telemedicine are critical of past studies' (a) methodological and analytical weaknesses; (b) focus on answering "Can we do this?" rather than "Should we do this?"; and (c) emphasis on patient benefits. Value chain analysis examines structural and executional cost drivers; a self-sustaining business model balances the cost and value associated with each telemedicine activity. We illustrate this analysis in a rural health program, examining teleradiography and telerehabilitation.</ab>

        <ab>This article points out the benefits of telehealth for the U.S.'s long-term care residents. The promise of better care and better quality of life to hundreds of thousands of residents living in long-term care facilities from the application of telehealth should not be viewed as some sort of slippery slope from which to steer clear. Some naysayers contend that telehealth is too expensive. They are taken in by the razzle dazzle of technology and assume it must be very expensive. But just as the sticker price of computers is on a constant, consumer-friendly descent, so too, are the telehealth costs of infrastructure and hardware. Telehealth may actually be a way to break some of the malpractice deadlock gripping the health care system.</ab>

The research reveals that 308,000 patients across the world were monitored remotely by providers in 2012 for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes, among others. It is inferred that primary care practices may save cost in offering telehealth services through acquiring basic video equipment.</ab>

        <ab>Summary Background The current model of general practitioner referral of patients to hospital specialists in the UK is sometimes associated with unnecessary duplication of investigations and treatments. We aimed to compare joint teleconsultations between general practitioners, specialists, and patients (virtual outreach) with standard outpatient referral. Methods Virtual outreach services were established in London and Shrewsbury. The general practitioners referred 3170 patients, of whom 2094 consented to participate in the study and were eligible for inclusion. 1051 patients were randomly assigned virtual outreach, and 1043 standard outpatient appointments. We followed up the patients for 6 months after their index consultation. The primary outcome measure was the offer of a follow-up outpatient appointment. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings: More patients in the virtual outreach group than the standard group were offered a follow-up appointment (502 [52%] vs 400 [41%], odds ratio 1.52 [95% CI 1.27-1.82], p&lt;0.0001). Significant differences in effects were observed between the two sites (p=0.009) and across different specialties (p&lt;0.0001). Virtual outreach increased the offers of follow-up appointments more in Shrewsbury than in London, and more in ear, nose, and throat surgery and orthopaedics than in the other specialties. Fewer tests and investigations were ordered in the virtual outreach group by an average of 0.79 per patient (0.37-1.21, p=0.0002). Patients' satisfaction (analysed per protocol) was greater after a virtual outreach consultation than after a standard outpatient consultation (mean difference 0.33 scale points [95% CI 0.23-0.43], p&lt;0.0001), with no heterogeneity between specialties or sites. Interpretation The trial showed that allocation of patients to virtual outreach consultations is variably associated with increased offers of follow-up appointments according to site and specialty, but leads to significant increases in...</ab>

        <ab>A "mobile telemedicine" is attempted where the mobile satellite communication and remote medicine are applied. This study aims at improving emergency care in a ship on the ocean or in an aircraft flying an international route. The problem has several special points which differ from the usual data communication or telemedicine. These points must be overcome to realize the system. This paper presents first the analysis, investigation and design for mobile telemedicine, and indicates its feasibility. Based on these results an experimental transmission system is constructed. The fundamental transmission characteristics are measured through the satellite link. By the measurement, the threshold of operation for this system for deteriorated C/N0 is determined, and it is verified that even an experimental system can realize a reliability which is sufficient in practice. Then a transmission experiment is made from a ship navigating close to the shore of Japan, and the basic operation as the mobile teletnedicine is verified.</ab>

        <ab>For some time now, successive generations of more sophisticated information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been adopted by organisations to enhance or replace more traditional methods of accessing, recording and communicating information used in problem-solving activities. Professionals in most industries have had some experience of the impact of ICT innovation and might be expected to resist innovations which they perceive to have the potential to disrupt crucial processes. This appears particularly likely to occur where there is a substantial tacit knowledge component. In this paper, we report the perceptions of key groups of healthcare professionals of the barriers to adoption of videoconferencing into knowledge-intensive processes mediating high-level problem-solving. While there was some shared perception of the critical problems, the interpretations of the underlying issues differed. The findings give some insight into the conceptualisation issues surrounding innovation management within complex systems which are emerging in the adoption of ICTs.

        <ab>A mobile telemedicine system was designed, implemented, and tested for real-time diagnosis during ambulance transport. The system uses multiple public wireless cellular phones to transmit video and patient biosignals from a moving ambulance to a hospital and delivers to the desktop computer of the receiving physician. The mobile unit on the ambulance is turn-key operated and has an image selection controller for paramedics to send images at specific times and to capture images at high frame rates. The mobile telemedicine system was installed on two ambulances and was successfully used in diagnosing acute ischemic stroke during the transport of six patients. Using the system, stroke specialists were able to remotely conduct neurological examinations which required evaluation of facial expressions and movement of arms and legs. Questionnaires completed by four users (two paramedics and two stroke specialists) of the mobile telemedicine system indicated that (1) the system did not intrude into the privacy of the patient or the paramedics, (2) it was easy to use, (3) it was adequate for conducting clinical examinations, and (4) it conveyed critical clinical information.</ab>

        <ab>A pilot system for a mammography tele-consultation in TaiChung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH), Taiwan is proposed in this paper. It is developed and designed based on a distributed system and implemented in a top-down high speed network hierarchy with communication security. It is also integrated with specific diagnostic tools and collaboration awareness tools currently available in TCVGH and linked with the external internet, Taiwan Academic Network (TANet) that will be upgraded into the next generation, TANet2 in the next five years. The distributed system is designed using a JAVA-based remote method invoking system. It allows the transport of images through a firewall combined with peripheral applications that include a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) server for image transmission, Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), Hospital Information System (HIS) and computer-aided diagnostic systems via a Java native interface. The communication security is implemented using ElGamal's public-key cryptosystem for identifications of authorization. Finally the specific mammography diagnostic tools and collaboration awareness tools demonstrated in the proposed system are developed in accordance with the Breast Imaging Reporting And Data System (BI-RADS) suggested by the American College of Radiology.</ab>

        <ab>Telemedicine is many things to many people. Only until a few years ago, telemedicine was equated to video teleconferencing between physicians, while nowadays, perhaps the most active area in telemedicine is the store-and-forward model. There is a big shift from private and dedicated modes of communications to connectivity through the Internet. Presented is a collection of applications that provide snapshots of this diversity. The key technical challenges identified from these experiences are connectivity and integration. Also, at issue are the evolution process through which a telemedicine application evolves and the ability to choose the fight set of technology for the diverse type of telemedicine applications. With the projected improvements in speed and quality of the Internet, wireless communication, and personal computational devices, it is expected that various concepts of telemedicine will develop into standard practices in tomorrow's health care.</ab>

The system is composed of seven agents, such as: a medical database management agent, an application agent, and a planning agent. Some simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of our system. The simulator was developed using JAFMAS (Java-based Agent Framework for Multiagent Systems).</ab>

        <ab>The current trend of cost containment in health care has prompted a search for innovative methods of providing the best quality care at the lowest possible cost. One method that has received much attention is the use of telemedicine to conduct evaluations at rural locations. There has been much research conducted in the area of telemedicine for radiology, and some other medical specialties, however there has been very little research examining the utilization of telemedicine for allied health, vocational rehabilitation, and Assistive Technology evaluations. In addition to providing an overview of telemedicine service delivery history and mechanisms, results of a focus group are discussed, and specific applications for the field of vocational rehabilitation are considered.</ab>

Access to telehealth systems was reportedly made easier by the telemedicine efforts of Wyoming through Wyoming Telehealth Consortium.</ab>

        <ab>Despite advances in medical science, the delivery of health care to Indians in remote reservation areas remains a problem. Fortunately, a potential solution has appeared from an unusual source: a NASA method for delivering medical services by using state-of-the-art telecommunications in lieu of conventional face-to-face clinical services. Telemedicine did, in fact, improve health conditions for the Papago tribe in southern Arizona. Consequently, the Indian Health Service (IHS) of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, obtained a new tool whereby health care delivery might be improved on all reservations. Perhaps equally important, the IHS was able to utilize industrial mathematical decision-modeling techniques to select from among alternative health care delivery systems for each reset ration.</ab>

        <ab>This study analyzes the relationship among eHealth profiles across 27 European Union Member States. It builds on prior research that uses multivariate statistical methods to provide a cross-country analysis on two dimensions: ICT penetration and availability compared with eHealth access and usage among health professionals. Based on the quantitative indicators/metrics used in our study, our results reveal that four distinct country groupings emerge as frontrunners, followers, leapfroggers and laggards. Frontrunners combine a strong ICT infrastructure with relatively high adoption of eHealth technologies. Our study suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to health IT is not recommended for EU Member States because policy-makers at the national level need to develop an eHealth roadmap that reflects national, regional and local conditions that go beyond technical imperatives.</ab>

        <ab>The article highlights the research on recognizing TRACnet's absorption using Richard Heeks' framework for evaluating healthcare management information system (HMIS) interventions by HIV/AIDS organizations in Rwanda. The authors stated that the TRACnet initiative is an electronic communication system parallel to the Rwandan HMIS and is designed to coordinate antiretroviral therapy (ART). In addition, the research shows that TRACnet is reducing the costs and time associated with submitting ART data. Moreover, there is a lack of response mechanisms attached to data submissions and technological factors limiting bi-directional communication due to the lack of understanding of the TRACnet interface.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents a study on assessment models for decision makers of all national health systems to correctly assess telemedicine services to take responsible decisions in their adoption into the routine clinical practice. The authors have stated that a wide range of applications have been tested since the 90s, however evidence of benefits is still lacking. In addition, the empirical and well-designed studies are generally focused on a single dimension, thus it fails to give a comprehensive appraisal of the application. They emphasized that the research aims to present a complete framework that links the main assessment dimensions to the phases of the assessment process.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the development of a technique to enable privacy during data mining in Tele-Health Care Systems. The author stated that to allow one to smokescreen sensitive item sets or patterns ahead of the execution of the data fishing process, a number of data fishing techniques, integrated with privacy protection mechanisms, have been developed. In addition, a new variant of the random projection-based perturbation technique for mystifying the tele-health care data of individuals called the flustering approach has been proposed with the impetus of increasing data utility.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: The convergence of data, voice, and multimedia communication over digital networks, coupled with continuous improvement in network capacity and reliability has resulted in a proliferation of communication technologies. Unfortunately, despite these new developments, there is no easy way to build new application-specific communication services. The stovepipe approach used today for building new communication services results in rigid technology, limited utility, lengthy and costly development cycle, and difficulty in integration. In this paper, we introduce communication virtual machine (CVM) that supports rapid conception, specification, and automatic realization of new application-specific communication services through a user-centric, model-driven approach. We present the concept, architecture, modeling language, prototypical design, and implementation of CVM in the context of a healthcare application.</ab>

        <ab>The development and proliferation of new information and communication technologies has generated some profound claims about the erasure of place. Whilst these claims have continued political and policy resonance, they are increasingly challenged in sociological debate, which emphasizes the persistence of the local. Following this lead, our article explores relations between technology and place. We develop our understanding through engagement with Science and Technology Studies, Actor Network Theory and geographical conceptualizations of place. Our argument is worked through a new empirical study of telemedicine, where new technologies are applied precisely to overcome place. Our analysis is that, on the contrary, empirical outcomes are legible only through the lens of place. This has important policy implications and broader implications for thinking about technology in contemporary debates about globalization.</ab>

        <ab>Telemedicine has been shown to be an effective means of managing follow-up care in chronic diseases such as depression. Exactly why telemedicine calls work, however, remains largely unknown because there are no adequate research tools to describe the complex communicative interactions in these encounters. We report here an ongoing project to investigate the efficacy of telemedicine in depression care, arguing that technical communication specialists have unique contributions to make to this kind of research.</ab>

        <ab>On-body area ultrawideband (UWB) communication is of high importance for promising new biomedical applications. However, there are currently few measurements or models describing on-body area propagation channels which put an emphasis on various body postures, Using the frequency-dependent finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method and a realistic human body model, we simulate various body postures for modeling on-body channels. Based on the FDTD numerical results, we derive an on-body propagation model and determine the model parameters for some representative transmission links on the human body. A good match is obtained between the data derived from FDTD and the statistically implemented models in terms of key communication metrics. In addition, for the chest-to-right-waist transmission link, an experiment is performed in order to verify the results from the FDTD method, and it is found that the model parameters agree well between the two approaches.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the integration of a virtual intensive care unit (ICU) by the Resurrection Health Care system in Chicago, Illinois to help improve quality and safety. Use of the virtual ICU involves having a dedicated critical care team consisting of an ICU physician, critical care nurses and support staff to monitor and treat intensive care patients from a remote location. The process requires the use of an integrated network of decision-making software to provide real-time vital sign and laboratory data to prompt clinicians to trends in patient condition.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: This study focuses on the Internet-based telemedicine with the goal of understanding the relationship between objective and subjective video quality measures and the decision making capability of medical professional using an ophthalmology video. Objective and subjective measures are calculated using PSNR and the perception of human viewers respectively. An emulated Internet testbed was created for experiments. Results indicate that jitter and delay have significant effect on the objective quality values. Subjective quality, on the other hand, not only depends on the same two factors, but also depends on which critical frames the provider is able to see and work with.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, I will argue that there is a deep connection between home-based care, technology, and the self. Providing the means for persons (especially older persons) to receive care at home is not merely a kindness that respects their preference to be at home: it is an important means of extending their selfhood and respecting the unique selves that they are. Home-based technologies like telemedicine and robotic care may certainly be useful tools in providing care for persons at home, but they also have important implications for sustaining selfhood in ways that are of value to individuals and those who care for them. I will argue, by appealing to Hilde Lindemann's notion of 'holding' persons' identities in place, that technological interventions are not only useful tools for improving and sustaining health and good care at home, but that they may also help to extend our personal identities and relational capacities in ways that are practically and ethically good. Because of these important goods, I will claim that there is a prima facie moral duty to do this 'holding' work and that it is best done by family members and loved ones who are well suited to the job because of their history and relationship with the individual that needs to be 'held' in place.</ab>

        <ab>Single snapshot evaluations of eHealth projects often lack depth when explaining the impact of human factor influences at the conceptualisation stages of a project. This paper explores the conceptualisation and prototype building of two eHealth projects undertaken in Denmark and Australia and develops a human factors evaluation framework applicable for use during the initial phases of eHealth projects for patient use. Initially the projects were reviewed using a human factors lens to identify individual project phases. Project elements in each project were determined and analysed using thematic analysis. A conceptual framework was then developed and applied to the project phases resulting in the identification and exploration of five key themes. The developed framework can complement existing eHealth evaluation frameworks and enrich them with a human factors viewpoint and highlights the need for further research on cultural influences and the intersections between each framework component. Finally, the paper highlights the need for patients to be considered as end users of eHealth systems and engaged early and throughout the development of eHealth systems.</ab>

        <ab>An alarm system suitable for pervasive healthcare in rural areas is presented. Taking advantage of ZigBee features, users can move freely around their habitual environment while enjoying constant protection. The resulting system is cost-effective, easily deployed (no wiring is needed) and the mobile device's batteries last for months. The user interface is a key issue when working with the elderly and those with disabilities. To ensure proper usability and avoid abandoning of the device, an alarm-detection procedure has been developed and contrasted with end-users. The application scenario is the isolated village of Fortanete, Spain, where the self-sustainability of the system is essential. In this environment, management of the alarm relies upon the user's relatives and neighbours to solve any problems that arise. Privacy and ethical considerations have also been addressed, as this kind of system can potentially invade the users' privacy; cognitive disabilities of the users also make it mandatory.</ab>

        <ab>As a response to the challenge of providing high-quality healthcare services with reasonable costs while the elderly population and the associated chronic diseases increase, SAPHIRE architecture provides an intelligent healthcare monitoring architecture. The monitoring of patients is achieved through a clinical decision support system based on clinical guidelines. SAPHIRE provides the necessary interoperability layers to access the patient's vital signs from wireless medical sensors and the electronic healthcare records of the patient in order to exploit them in the decision process seamlessly. This architecture is presented through two pilot applications: one for the bedside monitoring of cardiac patients at hospitals, and the other for homecare monitoring of the cardiac patients rehabilitated after a revascularisation therapy.</ab>

        <ab>A drug e-prescription demonstrator was created in compliance with existing legislation as well as security and privacy standards. A professional ID-card was built on a high security chip (ISTEC E4 High; EAL-5) with a Hash hardware accelerator for a digital signature placed in a single chip USB token. Commercial software products as well as development kits of the new hardware designed in the project were used to build an authentication, authorisation and electronic signature demonstrator. The degree of legal compliance was evaluated. The tested novel single chip USB token was highly efficient but limited by its 1.1 interface speed (12 Mbit/s). The chip, initialised with a banking-mask, inefficiently managed space for the health-care chain of trust. The public key and privilege management infrastructure was not able to handle health-care attributes in the appropriate extensions. Templates for role-rule privileges were not available and healthcare standards for security and privacy were not found in commercial products. The paper points out the urgent need for an e-health conformance label as well as a quality label for liability and confidence to gain users' trust.</ab>

        <ab>Non-communicable diseases including cancer are emerging as major public health problems in India. Awareness of cancer and its management are being taken as a high priority at the national level because of the increase in the incidence of the disease in the country. Telemedicine provides expert-based health care to understaffed remote sites and advanced emergency care through modern telecommunication and information technologies. The incidence of cancer can be reduced if the people are aware of cancer and its root causes. Recently, the introduction of telemedicine in oncology plays a vital role. Telemedicine helps in prevention, early detection, a faster cure, palliative care and rehabilitation in the management of cancer. The status of telemedicine services for cancer care in Kerala, India, and how telemedicine can be an effective solution of cancer-care delivery in India are explored.</ab>

        <ab>A general overview of the emerging wireless and networking technologies and their use to promote the ultimate goal of global health by means of deployment of a telemedicine paradigm is discussed. To achieve this the authors conduct a state-of-the-art study of recent wireless and medical sensor technologies in conjunction with investigation of continuously growing pressures for a better healthcare service throughout the world triggered by the growing age population, social transformations. The study reveals that in spite of available superior technological solutions the services are mostly too expensive, mostly inadequate to respond to the growing demand. Then it proposes a flagship solution of making the best use of the next generation of ‘wireless computing’ for building a new harmonised healthcare infrastructure for which the authors need to encourage researchers in the development of an innovative media-independent ubiquitous wireless telemedicine system for more cost effective superior quality healthcare services.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Premature and ill term babies born in regional Australia must be moved to another hospital with Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) facilities. Transferred pre-term and critically ill term babies have higher mortality rates and much higher rates of long term disability than similar babies born in hospitals with NICU facilities. This paper details the Bush Babies Broadband project that aims to significantly improve the quality of treatment for babies born in rural, remote as well as urban areas by providing the first on-demand virtual NICU architecture in Australia. Real-time data collected from medical monitors and ventilators attached to the baby, audiovisual streams and static physiological data such as X-ray images are transmitted to the consulting Neonatologist to gain a better picture of the patient''s condition than is currently available. The key contribution of this significant research is the infrastructure providing a mechanism for Neonatologists to receive information directly from a regional hospital, thereby preventing, in some cases, the immediate need to move the baby. A key benefit of this framework is that it is available to link regional hospitals with the supporting NICU Neonatologist ‘on demand’ eliminating the need to establish permanent point to point connections. This paper further describes the application of that architecture to a specific pilot connecting the Bathurst regional hospital with Neonatologists within the NICU at Nepean Hospital, Penrith Australia.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the application of telemedicine in commercial aviation. There are at least half a dozen or so makers of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) competing on innovation and price to serve the aviation emergency medicine markets. Remote diagnostics does for a range of vital signs what the AED does for cardiac arrest. Alasdair MacDonald, CEO of TeleMedic Systems, lays claim to being the first person to send real-time vitals from a commercial aircraft in flight to a ground-based physician.</ab>

        <ab>Recently, with the advances in digital signal processing, compression of biomedical signals has received great attention for telemedicine applications. In this paper, an adaptive transform coding-based method for compression of respiratory and swallowing sounds is proposed. Using special characteristics of respiratory sounds, the recorded signals are divided into stationary and nonstationary portions, and two different bit allocation methods (BAMs) are designed for each portion. The method was applied to the data of 12 subjects and its performance in terms of overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values was calculated at different bit rates. The performance of different quantizers was also considered and the sensitivity of the quantizers to initial conditions has been alleviated. In addition, the fuzzy clustering method was examined for classifying the signal into different numbers of clusters and investigating the performance of the adaptive BAM with increasing the number of classes. Furthermore, the effects of assigning different numbers of bits for encoding stationary and nonstationary portions of the signal were studied. The adaptive BAM with variable number of bits was found to improve the SNR values of the fixed BAM by S dB. Last, the possibility of removing the training part for finding the parameters of adaptive BAMs for each individual was investigated. The results indicate that it is possible to use a predefined set of BAMs for all subjects and remove the training part completely. Moreover, the method is fast enough to be implemented for real-time application.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on virtual intensive care unit (ICU). Telemedicine makes use of technology to oversee critical care delivery using both remote and onsite model. The telemedicine team consists critical care nurses and support staff at a remote area. The virtual ICU is a support to onsite caregivers and is guided by an organizational infrastructure which upholds critical care standards and multi-disciplinary collaboration. According to the article, telemedicine combines the use of technology and interpersonal communication.</ab>

        <ab>Given the increasing importance of eHealth as an integral part of eGovernment, this contribution concentrates on the issue of acceptance regarding the introduction of the German electronic health card (eHC). A brief introduction highlights the relevance of the subject and the differing acceptance rates of patients and service providers, i.e. physicians. Based on both the technology acceptance model and the relevant literature, important factors influencing the attitude towards and the potential use of the eHC are conceptualized and integrated in a research model. The empirical examination was conducted throughout Germany through an online survey of physicians. Overall, 502 responses were collected and included in the analysis, which was carried out with structural equation modelling using EQS. The empirical results show that the relevant determinants of the acceptance of the eHC in Germany, such as efficiency and usability of the system and the cost-benefit ratio, were properly identified.</ab>

        <ab>The accuracy of a Ka-band physiological movement detector was tested and compared for measurements from four different body orientations and at five different distances. A rigorous spectral analysis approach is developed when previously adopted small-angle approximation model is not applicable. This theory analyzes in detail the harmonics observed in phase-modulated Ka-band Doppler radar, explaining the reason for better heart-rate accuracy when detected from the back of the body. It also explains the advantage of double-sideband transmission in avoiding the null point problem. Simulations have been performed to illustrate this theory and provide design guidelines for the system. This theory has also been verified by experiments.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, the prototype development of a wrist-worn integrated health monitoring device (WIHMD) with tele-reporting function for emergency telemedicine and home telecare for the elderly is reported. The WIHMD consists of six vital biosignal measuring modules, which include a fall detector, a single-channel electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry (SpO2), respiration rate, and body surface temperature measuring units. The size of the WIHMD is  60 × 50 × 20 mm, except the wrist cuff; and the total system weighs 200 g, including two 1.5-V AAA-sized batteries. The functional objective of the WIHMD is to provide information concerning current condition, such as vital biosignals and locational information, with compromised fidelity to experts at a distance through the commercial cellular phone network. The developed system will provide the facility for rapid and appropriate directions to be given by experts in emergency situations and will enable the user or caregiver to manage changes in health condition with helpful treatment.</ab>

        <ab>The article utilizes the imagery of stretching out and expanding for exploring what happens when medical practices and health working arrangements are temporally and spatially reconfigured. Based on the tenets of contemporary practice theory and on the back of a three years' longitudinal study of telemedicine in northern Italy, the article investigates some of the practical issues raised by the subversion of the proximity principles that still underscore most current medical practices. The study argues that in order to cope with the expansion of their activity practitioners had to face three main practical problems: they had to redistribute their work and tasks among human and non-human elements, they had to reframe the ways in which the activity was made accountable, and they had to reconfigure the relationships between all those involved. The stretching out and expanding of medical practices in space and time implies thus much more than a simple redistribution of what was already there and it triggers profound changes which included the reframing of the object and content of the activity, tine emergence of new artefacts and new identities, and the modification of the geography of the power positions between all those involved.</ab>

        <ab>Growth in the global market for telemedical services is being driven by economics. Two operational models are already recognizable. "Nighthawk" providers are virtually indistinguishable from their domestic counterparts with respect to medical malpractice liability and price for service. Indian providers, in contrast, offer deep price discounts on services, but jurisdictional loopholes are likely to allow these providers a method to avoid medical malpractice liability. Hospitals that outsource their radiology services need to be aware of these differences, because hiring Indian telemedical providers will likely result in a shift of medical malpractice liability from providers to hospitals.</ab>

        <ab>Teleradiology, telepathology, and teleoncology are important applications of telemedicine. Recent advances in these fields include a preponderance of radiology PACS (Picture Archiving and Communications System) users, the implementation of around-the-clock teleradiology services at many hospitals, and the invention of the first ultrarapid whole-slide digital scanner based on the array microscope. These advances have led to the development of a new health-care-delivery clinical pathway called the ultrarapid breast care process (URBC), which has been commercialized as the UltraClinics® process. This process bundles telemammography, telepathology, and teleoncology services and has reduced the time it takes for a woman to obtain diagnostic and therapeutic breast-care planning services from several weeks to a single day. This paper describes the UltraClinics process in detail and presents the vision of a network of same-day telemedicine-enabled UltraClinics facilities, staffed by a virtual group practice of teleradiologists, telepathologists, and teleoncologists.</ab>

        <ab>One of the goals of telemedicine is to enable remote visualization and browsing of medical volumes. There is a need to employ scalable compression schemes and efficient client-server models to obtain interactivity and an enhanced viewing experience. First, we present a scheme that uses JPEG2000 and JPIP (JPEG2000 Interactive Protocol) to transmit data in a multi-resolution and progressive fashion. The server exploits the spatial locality offered by the wavelet transform and packet indexing information to transmit, in so far as possible, compressed volume data relevant to the clients query. Once the client identifies its volume of interest (VOI), the volume is refined progressively within the VOI from an initial lossy to a final lossless representation. Contextual background information can also be made available having quality fading away from the VOI. Second, we present a prioritization that enables the client to progressively visualize scene content from a compressed file. In our specific example, the client is able to make requests to progressively receive data corresponding to any tissue type. The server is now capable of reordering the same compressed data file on the fly to serve data packets prioritized as per the client's request. Lastly, we describe the effect of compression parameters on compression ratio, decoding times and interactivity. We also present suggestions for optimizing JPEG2000 for remote volume visualization and volume browsing applications. The resulting system is ideally suited for client-server applications with the server maintaining the compressed volume data, to be browsed by a client with a low bandwidth constraint.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses using old telecommunications protocols in Alaska as a solution to providing remote communities with higher bandwidth.  In regards to telemedicine (x-ray image attachments and diagnostic data), remote villages that don't have dial-up service are in need of a better telecommunications infrastructure in the event of a medical emergency.  It comments on a project funded by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) that addresses the issue by providing computers, software, and digital cameras.

        <ab>The article discusses the barriers to the widespread use of telemedicine. Included in the barriers discussed are physicians' license which are on a state-by-state basis, and regulations that inhibit treatment of patients electronically across states. It cites as an example the law recently enacted in Kansas which requires Kansas license for doctors to treat Kansas patients. It also mentions the introduction of a bill that will establish a Presidential Commission on Telemedicine.</ab>

        <ab>The increased use of electronic medical records and online sharing of such records is motivated by improved quality of healthcare delivery. However, this use has raised security and privacy concerns because sensitive medical data could be exposed to a variety of threats that exist in the online world, leading to problems such as medical identity theft and billing fraud. If not addressed, such concerns could become a barrier to the large-scale adoption and sharing of electronic medical records. To ease such concerns, we argue that the eHealth Exchange, which is a federal initiative for online exchange of healthcare information, needs to be augmented to provide greater patient awareness and control. We take an approach that informs the patient when her health data is accessed by a healthcare enterprise that is not already trusted by the patient. Such awareness is ensured even when some systems in the health information sharing environment become compromised. We enhance accountability support within eHealth Exchange by using digitally signed logs of sharing records that cannot be modified or refuted. We implement and evaluate these mechanisms in the open-source CONNECT system that follows the eHealth Exchange specifications.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the important contributions of audiovisual technology in the improvement of teaching medicine among physicians. Physicians have long hold grand rounds to discuss patients cases and educate aspiring physicians. With the aim of improving such practice, the Arizona Telemedicine Program (ATP) drew on its extensive use of video-conferencing equipment to enhance the Institute for Advanced Telemedicine and Telehealth. This new method and use of technology put the T-Health Institute at the top of the Education &amp; Acamedia category. Dr. Ronald Weinstein explains that its specific mission is to use technology to allow interdiscplinary team training.</ab>

They developed the Remote Evaluation of Acute isCHemic stroke (REACH Call), a complete, secure Web-based service powered by integrated audio-visual communication capabilities and decision support tools. REACH needed only a standard personal computer (PC) with a Web cam and broadband Internet connection to connect a specialist with a rural emergency department (ED).</ab>

It states that the center enables medical professionals to track patients' health remotely via telephone and video-conferencing screens. It also lowers health care costs, allows home care agencies to provide more efficient, targeted care, and reduces hospital admissions. A survey reveals that 20.7% of home health care agencies have used telemedicine.</ab>

        </sug>
        <ab>Context: Policymakers seeking to introduce expensive national eHealth programs would be advised to study lessons from elsewhere. But these lessons are unclear, partly because a paradigm war (controlled experiment versus interpretive case study) is raging. England's $20.6 billion National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT) ran from 2003 to 2010, but its overall success was limited. Although case study evaluations were published, policymakers appeared to overlook many of their recommendations and persisted with some of the NPfIT's most criticized components and implementation methods. Methods: In this reflective analysis, illustrated by a case fragment from the NPfIT, we apply ideas from Ludwig Wittgenstein's postanalytic philosophy to justify the place of the 'n of 1' case study and consider why those in charge of national eHealth programs appear reluctant to learn from such studies. Findings: National eHealth programs unfold as they do partly because no one fully understands what is going on. They fail when this lack of understanding becomes critical to the programs' mission. Detailed analyses of the fortunes of individual programs, articulated in such a way as to illuminate the contextualized talk and action ('language games') of multiple stakeholders, offer unique and important insights. Such accounts, portrayals rather than models, deliver neither statistical generalization (as with experiments) nor theoretical generalization (as with multisite case comparisons or realist evaluations). But they do provide the facility for  heuristic generalization (i.e., to achieve a clearer understanding of what is going on), thereby enabling more productive debate about eHealth programs' complex, interdependent social practices. A national eHealth program is best conceptualized not as a blueprint and implementation plan for a state-of-the-art technical system but as a series of overlapping, conflicting, and mutually misunderstood language games that combine to produce a situation of ambiguity, paradox, incompleteness, and confusion. But going beyond technical 'solutions' and engaging with these language games would clash with the bounded rationality that policymakers typically employ to make their eHealth programs manageable. This may explain their limited and contained response to the nuanced messages of in-depth case study reports. Conclusion: The complexity of contemporary health care, combined with the multiple stakeholders in large technology initiatives, means that national eHealth programs require considerably more thinking through than has sometimes occurred. We need fewer grand plans and more learning communities. The onus, therefore, is on academics to develop ways of drawing judiciously on the richness of case studies to inform and influence eHealth policy, which necessarily occurs in a simplified decision environment.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Recent research on the development and use of information and communication technology (ICT) has focused on the emergent use of technology in practice and the multiplicity of outcomes being simultaneously negotiated by different groups and individuals. In this paper, we seek to understand this emergent process by examining the interrelationship between the context(s) in which ICTs are introduced, the ways in which ICTs are enacted in practice, and the role of different technological artifacts. We pursue the value of these conceptual developments in an interpretive case study on the introduction of a telemedicine system in the healthcare region of Crete, Greece. Some key implications arising from the case study refer to the relationship between power relationships and organizational change; the relationship between existing work practices and resistance to ICT-mediated change; and the role of different artifacts in negotiations of power, as well as in processes of community formation.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: ‘Telecare’ is the use of information and communication technology to facilitate health and social care delivery to individuals in their own homes. Governments around the world are seeking to introduce telecare partly to help address the challenges posed by an ageing society. Telecare is inherently complex to implement and operate because it involves combination of technological and organisational innovation in an environment of diverse stakeholders. Using research on two telecare schemes in the UK, the paper explores the way project complexity, organisational context and project management approach interacted during the planning and implementation phases. The paper discusses how insights from research in related areas, including medical technology and service sector innovation in general, could help to explain why mainstream telecare delivery has been difficult and draws conclusions on the role of project management in the implementation of innovation.</ab>

        <ab>In the health care domain, a major challenge is how to provide better health care services to an increasing number of people using limited financial and human resources. Wireless patient monitoring has the potential to support these multiple and conflicting requirements. However, the current quality and reliability of patient monitoring have not been very satisfactory due to the unpredictable and spotty coverage of infrastructure-oriented wireless networks. Ad hoc wireless networks can be formed among mobile and wearable patient-monitoring devices for improving the coverage of patient monitoring when infrastructure-oriented networks are not accessible. In this article, we provide support for reliable wireless patient monitoring by presenting several protocols for power management of devices, assisted power control, and sleep strategy. The performance results show that high reliability of message delivery can be obtained while maintaining a level of power conservation.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: The Republic of Ireland is characterised by few urban conurbations and a high rural population, including significant numbers of island dwellers. Information communication technologies (ICT), including telemedicine, present opportunities to address rural health-service delivery issues. As in other countries, the recent National Health Information Strategy is regarded as pivotal to the modernisation of the Irish healthcare system. There is, however, a dearth of research about telemedicine in Ireland. This paper reports, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic review of telemedicine in the two regional healthboards in the Republic of Ireland. Details of 11 telemedicine services, all initiated by local policy, will be presented. Results of an interview study with service providers about their experiences of the practices and processes involved in telemedicine service delivery are also provided. The focus of our analysis is two-fold. We assess the resonance of these Irish data with the international literature with particular reference to a recently developed model for the normalisation of telemedicine. For the first time, this model which was developed in the United Kingdom is applied to a fresh set of empirical data in a different healthcare context. We then discuss a number of health information policy issues for Ireland and elsewhere arising from our analysis.</ab>

        <ab>The development, adoption, and acceptance of eHealth systems that change and improve patient self-care have been promising, but the results have been mixed and the work mostly atheoretical. In this paper, we respond to this opportunity by developing and assessing an eHealth system for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. Study participants used the eHealth system for a 12-month period after diagnosis in an attempt to acquire an understanding about their diabetes, develop self-care activities (e.g., blood glucose testing), and improve their biomedical outcomes. Drawing upon theories and methods from information systems and upon the Precede-Proceed model of health promotion planning, we explored the double adoption of eHealth technology and its antecedents, self-care practices and their antecedents, and improvements in biomedical outcomes important to long-term diabetes health. Path model results indicate important implications for information systems, eHealth, and health promotion practice and research, which are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on Telemedicine that may represent the salvation for home health agencies reeling under the effects of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Although Medicare does not pay home health agencies directly for telemonitoring, the technology does present clear financial benefits. Home health agencies can use telemonitoring to improve efficiencies, reduce costs, increase revenue, and grow market share. Telemonitoring can provide the basis for a home health agency's development of a disease state management program. Such a program can help the agency reduce costs without compromising quality of care, thereby making the agency attractive to managed care organizations.

        <ab>This paper describes a project carried out in the lab- oratory of Principles of Bioengineering within the Telecommunications Engineering degree (five academic years plus a final thesis). The main object of this project is to set up a portable system for the acquisition, analysis, and transmission by mobile telephony of the electrocardiogram (ECG) of an indeterminate number of patients. The network of patients is managed from a control center (C C), comprising a personal computer (PC) with application software and a mobile telephony communications system. In a real system, each patient would have a patient terminal with a microprocessor- based, ECG-acquisition system with processing and transmission by mobile telephony. Time and technical considerations mean that, in the project, the patient terminal will have to be implemented in a PC. To perform this project, the students must have a wide range of knowledge acquired in this course and in other subjects required for this degree: design of bioamplifiers, information-processing algorithms, mobile-telephony communications, user-inter- face programming, etc. Having to use these concepts will no doubt serve as a stimulus to the students carrying out the work.</ab>

        <ab>Telecommunications access in the rural and remote areas of Australia has come under considerable scrutiny in recent years. In the past decade, various Federal Government reports and inquiries have citied inadequate infrastructure, lack of service provision, the high cost of access and "thin" markets as key impediments. Whilst these difficulties are not restricted to rural and remote Australia, they tend to impact disproportionately on regional communities, notably in education and health service provision. Particularly at risk are the indigenous communities in rural and remote regions of Australia. In this paper telecommunications infrastructure is perceived as the lynch-pin for achieving sustainable economic and social development. It is suggested that without appropriate development of information infrastructure, the disparities already experienced by rural and remote communities will be further exacerbated as the reliance of goods and services over computer-mediated networks increases. The paper offers a new paradigm that will assist in maintaining a competitive telecommunications environment and facilitate the sustainable social and economic development of rural and remote communities.</ab>

        <ab>The high burden of disease in developing countries often makes it difficult for health systems in these countries to attain the same level of specialist skills as industrialized countries. Technology transfer is one way to improve specialist skills whilst at the same time reducing the burden of disease. This paper describes the use of teleophthalmology, a form of telemedicine, as a mode of technology transfer between the United Kingdom and South Africa. As the burden of eye disease in South Africa is high, the country cannot afford the level of ophthalmic specialization achieved in the UK. The paper estimates the cost-effectiveness of the technology transfer project in terms of a cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted. We found the technology transfer project to be cost-effective in reducing the burden of eye disease, and that practitioners in South Africa also learned novel procedures that could help future patients and improve cost-effectiveness. Technology transfer using telemedicine is a cost-effective method that richer countries can employ to aid capacity building in the health care systems of poorer countries.</ab>

        <ab>The present and the future of health information are based on eHealth and knowledge management. Some aspects of this future were discussed at the High Level Ministerial Conference on eHealth, held in Barcelona in March 2010, where eHealth was seen as a tool for integration in European politics. The problem of access to health information on the internet and knowledge management policies as an effective tool in the improvement of clinical practice and the search for an excellent health system are also analyzed in this article.</ab>

        <ab>The Internet is beyond the reach of about six percent of Americans, limiting their access to general information and communications and to health information in particular. Eight of 10 Internet users look online for a range of health-related information to understand medical conditions and treatments, access care providers and learn about insurance. Consumers, the federal government, the business community and access providers all have a stake in eHealth information access. The government has promoted awareness and understanding of health issues and provided funding for broadband and wireless telecommunications infrastructure. Businesses rely on consumers to make use of health information, and several major telecom firms have provided hardware and training to enable eHealth endeavors. Efforts must address basic Internet connectivity and user costs and awareness, obstacles that undermine availability of important health information to consumers.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we present an ‘emulation environment’ for the design and planning of QoS-enabled IP networks. Specifically, QoS support for real-time traffic in future IP networks require ‘fault tolerance’ for mission-critical applications such as tele-medicine. Based on this premise, our goal is to design the QoS network system for the traffic management so that QoS requirements are satisfied. Routing is a key component of this architecture, in which it enables the efficient use of the provisioned bandwidth. Our approach is to make routers in the network capable of finding QoS paths in a distributed manner in response to changing traffic demands. As an extension of QoS routing, each router is able to compute ‘multiple QoS paths’ to the same destination. The multiple QoS paths are utilized in parallel making the entire network system less prone to network failures. In computing multiple QoS paths, practical issues such as computation latency and resource requirement must be considered. With the use of multiple QoS paths, our emulation environment permits us to design more reliable QoS network systems and to test various applications for feasibility before deployment. This paper presents the multiple QoS algorithms with notable enhancements and the system architecture for fault tolerance. The relevant experiment results have also been presented.</ab>

        <ab>Telemedicine is a very exciting field worldwide. Nigeria has a population of more than 120 million people, a major percentage of which live in the remote rural areas, whereas with the best-equipped hospitals and scarce medical experts are distributed in the urban cities. These people living in remote rural and poorer areas have limited access to basic healthcare. Geographic isolation, the scarcity of physicians and hospitals, and difficulties of travel to larger cities where such care is available are among the factors limiting this access. Governments at federal, state and local levels, have been making healthcare in these remote rural areas their focal point over the years so as to enable citizens in both rural and urban areas to have equal access to medical services and clinical healthcare despite the geographic isolation barriers but this effort has only been partly successful. Therefore, establishment of an Internet-based telemedicine system would be most useful in achieving government''s aims of bringing useful healthcare to these remote rural and poorer areas. This among other things would improve the quality of healthcare in rural and outlying areas, lower costs of delivering healthcare and give remotely placed physicians the opportunity to consult over any patient''s case. In this paper, an Internet-based telemedicine environment is developed for Nigeria, specifically to support consultations among remotely placed patients, rural health workers and specialists in the urban cities and provide a secure access to remote patient records. The paper further discusses some of the challenges and implementation issues of telemedicine in Nigeria.</ab>

        <ab>A great promise of telemedicine has been to help isolated or scattered populations gain access to health services. Telemedicine can be used to deliver healthcare to poor areas in countries with scarce infrastructure and to developing countries. But while information and communication technologies have tremendous potential for improving healthcare, one has to bear in mind that in rural areas of many developing countries, telephone networks and computers are scarce. This is especially true in the health sector. The facts highlight important differences between developed and developing countries that condition any telemedicine project. Moreover, there is a technology gap between urban and rural zones within developing countries themselves.</ab>

        <ab>Educational programs in Medical Informatics and Telemedicine offered at the Politecnico di Milano are described. At present they refer to the (five-year) Laurea degree, the (three-year) Diploma Universitario degree, the post-Laurea (three-year) Doctoral degree, the (one-year) post-Laurea Master's degree, and a continuing education program. The general aim of the educational efforts is to enable the students to become information and communication technology experts in whom the physician believes. The success in student attendance and in after-graduation company acceptance is remarkable. Nevertheless, in Italy, the universities are now starting considerable reform of all educational engineering programs.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the challenges associated with telemedicine in the U.S. The author says reimbursement policies of both private and government payers are scattershot, some telemedicine projects originally subsidized by federal agencies are ending, and physicians working with patients remotely are discovering a whole new minefield of legal challenges to navigate. Another challenge is getting physicians on board, says Jonathan Linkous of the American Telemedicine Association.</ab>

        <ab>Telemedicine is proving valuable in the delivery of health care services. With increased competition in telecommunication markets and lower costs, the possibility of providing affordable teletherapy services for the 21[sup st] century is now a goal that can be achieved. Recognition that parent training is a vital component of successful treatment programmes makes the use of teletherapy from clinic to home an ideal medium of sharing skills with carets. Commercially available products were selected on the basis of cost effectiveness, user friendliness and audio-visual quality. Parents reported increased knowledge and confidence in developing their child's communication skills and teletherapy was demonstrated to be an effective, reliable and exciting addition to a new era of therapy provision.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes the UIcluster software tool, which partitions expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences and other genetic sequences into “clusters” based on sequence similarity. Ideally, each cluster will contain sequences that all represent the same gene. UIcluster has been developed over the course of 4 years to solve this problem efficiently and accurately for large data sets consisting of tens or hundreds of thousands of EST sequences. The latest version of the application has been parallelized using the MPI standard. Both the computation and memory requirements of the program can be distributed among multiple (possibly distributed) UNIX processes.</ab>

        <ab>Electronic medical image viewers combined with picture archival and communication systems have become a common part of how hospitals manage their images. Typically, these electronic viewers are platform-dependent and are designed to make use of images stored on a workstation or local area network. However, the rise of the Internet and the ubiquity of the Web browser open up a wide range of new possibilities for distributing and accessing these images. The Internet allows us to pull information distributed across many geographically separated data sources, while the Web browser provides a common environment from where programs can be launched. This document details the design of an Internet-based, platform-independent medical image viewing system that harnesses the potential of these technologies.</ab>

        <ab>A system for the automatic measurement of the circadian activity deviations in telemedicine has been developed within the framework of a "Health Integrated Smart Home Information System" (HIS²). HIS² is an experimental platform for the evaluation and the development of technologies in order to ensure the security and quality of life for patients who need home based medical monitoring. Location sensors are placed in each room of the HIS², allowing the monitoring of patient's successive activity phases within the patient's home environment. We proceeded with a sampling in an hourly schedule to detect weak rhythmic variations. Based on numerous measurements, we established a mean value with confidence limits. These also allowed us to define a zone within which the patient's activity is qualified to be "predictable." Alerts are set off if the patient's activity deviates from this zone.</ab>

        <ab>A web-based system for asynchronous multimedia messaging between shoulder replacement surgery patients at home and their surgeons was developed and tested. A web browser plug-in simplifies the process of capturing video and transferring it to a web site for novice computer users. The design of the video capture plug-in can be reused to acquire and securely transfer any type of data over the web. For example, readings from home biosensor instruments (e.g., glucometers and spirometers) that can be connected to a personal computer can be transferred to a home telemedicine web site. Both patients and doctors can access this web site to monitor health status longitudinally. Six patients, whose familiarity with computers ranged from no experience to expert users, used the system. All of the subjects were able to use the system to check treatment reminders and to send at least one message with video to their surgeons. The surgeons monitored the system regularly and always responded to messages within 24 h during the six-month trial period.</ab>

        <ab>A virtual simulation (VS) system is a software system that enables the delineation of anatomical structures, and the placement of irradiation fields for the purpose of radiation treatment planning, making use of patient's tomographic data, instead of the real patient. Since patient's tomographic data can be communicated between distinct radiotherapy departments, collaborative work on VS, connecting remote health care professionals, becomes feasible. In this paper, an environment enabling real-time collaboration on VS is presented. The environment architecture is based on both offline and online communication of data under a secure framework and can be directly integrated into the infrastructure of a radiotherapy department. The online collaboration relies on the simultaneous execution of all actions at both collaborating sites, and prerequisites the offline communication of the data set on which the collaboration will be performed. Analytical description of the custom-made layered service, which supports the offline communication is given, along with a detailed presentation of the secure management of messages, which enables the real-time collaboration. The technical evaluation of the environment highlights the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, since real-time secure collaboration on VS is achieved.</ab>

        <ab>One of the goals of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to reach more than 80% of eligible women in mammography screening by the year 2000 yet remains as a challenge. In fact, a recent medical report reveals that while other types of cancer are experiencing negative growth, breast cancer has been the only one with a positive growth rate over the last few years. This is primarily due to the fact that 1) examination process is a complex and lengthy one and 2) it is not available to the majority of women who live in remote sites. Currently for mammography screening, women have to go to doctors or cancer centers/hospitals annually while high-risk patients may have to visit more often. One way to resolve these problems is by the use of advanced networking technologies and signal processing algorithms. On one hand, software modules can help detect, with high precision, true negatives (TN), while marking true positives (TP) for further investigation. Unavoidably, in this process some false negatives (FN) will be generated that are potentially life threatening; however, inclusion of the detection software improves the TP detection and, hence, reduces FNs drastically. Since TNs are the majority of examinations on a randomly selected population, this first step reduces the load on radiologists by a tremendous amount. On the other hand, high-speed networking equipment can accelerate the required clinic-lab connection and make detection, segmentation, and image enhancement algorithms readily available to the radiologists. This will bring the breast cancer care, caregiver, and the facilities to the patients and expand diagnostics and treatment to the remote sites. This research describes asynchronous transfer mode telemammography network (ATMTN) architecture for real-time, online screening, detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. ATMTN is a unique high-speed network integrated with automatic robust computer-assisted diagnosis-detection/digital signal processing (CAD/DSP)...</ab>

        <ab>Nowadays, there are a very large number of patients that need specific health support at home. The deployment of broadband communication networks is making feasible the provision of home care services with a proper quality of service. This paper presents a telehomecare multimedia platform that runs over integrated services digital network and internet protocol using videoconferencing standards H.320 and H.323, and standard TV set for patient interaction. This platform allows online remote monitoring: ECG, heart sound, blood pressure. Usability, affordability, and interoperability were considered for the design and development of its hardware and software components. A first evaluation of technical and usability aspects were carried forward with 52 patients of a private clinic and 10 students in the University. Results show a high rate (mean = 4.33, standard deviation—SD = 1.63 in a five-points Likert scale) in the global perception of users on the quality of images, voice, and feeling of virtual presence.</ab>

        <ab>The field of interest discussed in this study is a novel codification scheme for (vital signs) medical device communication and patient monitoring data interchange, into the context of effective home care service provisioning. With medical technology having developed in isolation and major manufacturers developing their own proprietary communication protocols, which preclude connection to devices from different manufacturers, and with healthcare trends having evolved, pointing to primary care, telecare and home care monitoring, there is an increasing need for technical standardization in healthcare environments and the development of protocols that enable communication in a structured and open way. In this study, a novel codification scheme has been developed, based on two healthcare informatics standards, the VITAL and DICOM Sup. 30, in addressing the robust interchange of waveform and medical data for a home care application. Based on this scheme, we created a real-time facility, consisting of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit, that enables home telemonitoring, by installing the telemedicine unit at the patient's home while the base unit remains at the physician's office or hospital. The system allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3-lead ECG, pulse rate, blood pressure and SpO[sub 2]) of the patient. This paper presents an object-oriented design with unified modeling language (UML) of a class hierarchy for exchanging the acquired medical data and performing alert management, and investigates the applicability of the proposed scheme into a commercial patient-connected medical device, thus addressing service and functionality requirements with focus on home-care applications. The system has been validated for technical performance over several telecommunication means and for clinical validity via real patient-involved pilot trials.</ab>

        <ab>Rapid advances of the Internet, multimedia technology and virtual reality have opened new opportunities for organizations to re-design their traditional functional units often separated by vast distances into a virtually cohesive enterprise capable of responding quickly to market changes. This paper proposes an agent-based framework for supporting collaborative work among human and non-human teleworkers, namely, software agents. The proposed framework enables the geographically dispersed organization to distribute work across the Internet and embed intelligent software agents capable of supporting decision to facilitate implementation of complex and distributed decision making. The development of agent-based corporate information systems is a process of putting together a coordinated workflow of collaborating agents. The proposed framework is currently being simulated on a telemedicine project.</ab>

        <ab>Recent advances in information and biomedicine technology have significantly increased the technical feasibility, clinical viability, and economic affordability of telemedicine-enabled service collaboration and delivery. Health care organizations around the world have become increasingly interested in acquiring and implementing telemedicine technology to improve or extend existing patient care and services. The ultimate success of telemedicine in an adopting organization requires adequate attention to both technological and managerial issues. This study examined organizational technology adoption, an essential management issue facing many health care organizations interested in or currently evaluating telemedicine. On the basis of a framework proposed by Tornatzky and Fleischer [1], we developed a research model for targeted technology adoption and empirically evaluated it in a survey study that involved most of the public health care organizations in Hong Kong. Results from our exploratory study suggest that the model exhibits reasonable significance and explanatory utility to differentiate between adopting and nonadopting organizations. Specifically, the collective attitude of medical staff and perceived service risks were found to be significant determinants of targeted technology adoption. Several research and management implications that emerged from our study findings are also discussed.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents a novel design of printed hybrid fractal tree (PHFT) antenna using bacterial forging optimization (BFO) in conjunction with curve fitting technique. The antenna geometry is based on the hybrid structure obtained by integrating meander line geometry with fractal tree, whose geometrical descriptors are determined by means of BFO. The fractal shape allows the new hybrid antenna to be effectively reduced in size without significantly impairing performance. Representative results of optimized antenna are reported in order to access the effectiveness of the developed approach for reliable implementation in wireless telemedicine applications. Moreover, useful guidelines on the effects of finite ground plane size on antenna characteristics have been adequately analyzed.</ab>

        <ab>Even despite policy efforts aimed at reducing health-related disparities, evidence mounts that population-level gaps in literacy and healthcare quality are increasing. This widening of disparities in American culture is likely to worsen over the coming years due, in part, to our increasing reliance on lnternet-based technologies to disseminate health information and services. The purpose of the current article is to incorporate health literacy into an Integrative Model of eHealth Use. We argue for this theoretical understanding of eHealth literacy and propose that macro-level disparities in social structures are connected to health disparities through the micro-level conduits of eHealth literacy, motivation, and ability. In other words, structural inequities reinforce themselves and continue to contribute to healthcare disparities through the differential distribution of technologies that simultaneously enhance and impede literacy, motivation, and ability of different groups (and individuals) in the population. We conclude the article by suggesting pragmatic implications of our analysis.</ab>

        <ab>. An effective methodology for dealing with data extracted from clinical surveys on heart failure linked to the Public Health Database is proposed. A model for recurrent events is used for modelling the occurrence of hospital readmissions in time, thus deriving a suitable way to compute individual cumulative hazard functions. Estimated cumulative hazard trajectories are then treated as functional data, and they are used as covariates along with clinical survey data within the framework of generalized linear models with functional covariates.</ab>

        <ab>Given persistent communication inequalities, it is important to develop interventions to improve Internet and health literacy among underserved populations. These goals drove the Click to Connect project, a community-based eHealth intervention that provided novice computer users of low socioeconomic position with broadband Internet access, training classes, a Web portal, and technical support. In this article, we describe the strategies used to recruit and retain this population, the budgetary implications of such strategies, and the challenges and successes we encountered. Results suggest that personal contact between study staff and participants and provision of in-depth technical support were central to successful recruitment and retention. Such investments are essential to realize the promise of eHealth with underserved populations.</ab>

It cites that under the rule, hospitals are allowed to accept the credentialing and privileging decisions of the distant-site facilities that provide the telemedicine services. It notes that the Joint Commission will be required by the new law to periodically secure CMS approval of its standards for the purpose of conferring Medicare-deemed status onto hospitals.</ab>

Bioengineering professor Boris Rubinsky created a portable electromagnetic scanner that can work in tandem with a regular cell phone and a computer. The mobile scanner plugs into the phone, which beams the data to the computer, generating an image that can be transmitted to a doctor or hospital far away. Cell phones may also help reduce the frequency of medical errors.</ab>

        <ab>We explore some recurring socio-technical problems encountered in the development of infrastructure for sharing and re-using data across sites and social scales for eHealth research. We link these problems to contradictions between underlying assumptions about data as a commodity whose reuse is not compromised when it is extracted from the context in which it has been captured, and the reality of data as entangled with, and constituted through, local practice. To illustrate these problems, we draw on the experiences of a number of HealthGrid projects developing infrastructures for data sharing and reuse, and trace the strategies that have evolved to address them. These experiences problematize the "one size fits all" model initially adopted by HealthGrids, and highlight the need for design and development strategies that are able to engage with local needs and thereby ensure that the technical infrastructure is properly aligned with the human infrastructure it is supposed to support.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on the telemedicine program of the University of Texas in Arlington, Texas, which is the nation's oldest and largest program, covering roughly 100,000 inmates in 12 prisons. Infirmary primary-care doctors or nurses, use specialized equipment such as electronic stethoscopes and otoscopes to transmit real-time audio and high-resolution video images to a hospital hundreds of miles away, and make the program a huge success. Both the off-site doctor and patients have two monitors so they can see each other as well as their own images. Based on the efficiency of prison telemedicine programs, the Commerce Department of the university set up a $1.2 million telemedicine network to serve patients in the rural south-western region of Virginia. The U.S. military also uses telemedicine programs in the Bosnian operations. A couple of companies have also focused on telemedicine networks as an inexpensive way to serve isolated, homebound elderly and chronically ill subscribers.</ab>

The child's life was saved through an early diagnosis of the disease via a video conference made to a neonatal cardiology specialist. Marty Cooper, the father of the cellular phone, predicts the possibility of having a wearable patch that will be able to indicate a plethora of sickness in one's body. The author says that Hippocrates, the late Greek physician, would have smiled hearing about these developments.</ab>

It notes that the next physician-patient communication frontier is electronic mail where patients are armed with knowledge by Internet. The early adopters of the trend say that patient satisfaction and loyalty have increased along with the electronic mail volume. Moreover, it suggests that all must be prepared to escalate and cross the new bounds of online physician-patient communication.</ab>

        <ab>Large-scale investment in health care information technology (IT) infrastructure will not take place without leadership by the federal government. But how the federal government supports the financing of health care IT is critical. Health care IT development has multiple aspects, but it is fundamentally a problem of community infrastructure development. A policy approach that has had consistent success in financing our country's essential physical infrastructure in transportation and environmental protection will be well suited to fostering health care IT infrastructure as well. We propose the creation of a health care IT revolving loan fund program to invest public dollars in health care IT infrastructure projects through community-level nonprofit lending agencies.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that according to an August 2013 study, conducted by the periodical "Health Affairs," despite knowing the benefits of electronic communication with patients, medical practices consider it as a disadvantage. It says that the benefits of electronic visits and communication include improvement in patient satisfaction, convenience, and higher quality care, but traditional payment models do not support the concept of medical care, provided electronically.</ab>

        <ab>Objective. To identify policies that increase access to health care for undocumented Mexican immigrants. Materials and methods. Four focus groups (n=34 participants) were conducted with uninsured Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles, California. The feasibility and desirability of different policy proposals for increasing access were discussed by each group. Results. Respondents raised significant problems with policies including binational health insurance, expanded employer-provided health insurance, and telemedicine. The only solution with a consensus that the change would be feasible, result in improved access, and they had confidence in was expanded access to community health centers (CHC's). Conclusions. Given the limited access to most specialists at CHC's and the continued barriers to hospital care for those without health insurance, the most effective way of improving the complete range of health services to undocumented immigrants is through immigration reform that will bring these workers under the other health care reform provisions.</ab>
        <ab>Objetivo. Identificar políticas para mejorar el acceso a la salud en migrantes indocumentados mexicanos en los Estados Unidos. Material y métodos. Se realizaron cuatro grupos focales (34 participantes) con migrantes mexicanos sin seguro médico residentes de Los Ángeles, California. Se discutieron la factibilidad y pertinencia de varias propuestas de políticas de mejora en el acceso. Resultados. Los participantes identificaron limitaciones profundas con propuestas como seguro binacional de salud, expansión de seguro por medio de trabajo y programas de telemedicina. La única con consenso de factibilidad, accesibilidad y pertinencia fue el crecimiento de la red de centros a la atención de salud comunitaria (CHC por sus siglas en ingles). Conclusiones. Dado la escasez de especialistas en CHC y las barreras para acudir a hospitales cuando no cuentan con seguro médico en EUA, la manera más eficaz para mejorar acceso para migrantes indocumentados es por medio de una reforma de las leyes de migración.</ab>

        <ab>This article reports that advanced robotic telemedicine technology and intensive stroke training program have improved quality of care to stroke patients in Michigan. Deckerville and 33 other hospitals in the state now have access to St. Joseph's stroke neurologists twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, through the Michigan Stroke Network. Hospitals throughout the network get instant access to St. Joseph stroke neurologists via a remote-control robot manufactured by Intouch Health. Similar networks are developing in a number of states.</ab>

        <ab>Hospitals often fail to implement new practices due to an inability to promote their use among professionals. How effective promotion can be designed and organized remains unclear, however. The present work addresses this question by investigating the implementation of a cardiologic telesurveillance system in 12 hospitals. Despite an identical technology and unproblematic installation, only in five cases full implementation was achieved. Four promotion strategies—focused on a different combination of three aspects (planning, team involvement, and hero innovation)—were identified through case studies. Qualitative comparative analysis was then employed to identify three alternative strategies for effective promotion.</ab>

        <ab>This study presents a novel approach to force feedback in robot-assisted surgery. It consists of substituting haptic stimuli, composed of a kinesthetic component and a skin deformation, with cutaneous stimuli only. The force generated can then be thought as a subtraction between the complete haptic interaction, cutaneous, and kinesthetic, and the kinesthetic part of it. For this reason, we refer to this approach as sensory subtraction. Sensory subtraction aims at outperforming other nonkinesthetic feedback techniques in teleoperation (e.g., sensory substitution) while guaranteeing the stability and safety of the system. We tested the proposed approach in a challenging 7-DoF bimanual teleoperation task, similar to the Pegboard experiment of the da Vinci Skills Simulator. Sensory subtraction showed improved performance in terms of completion time, force exerted, and total displacement of the rings with respect to two popular sensory substitution techniques. Moreover, it guaranteed a stable interaction in the presence of a communication delay in the haptic loop.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents a case study on the implications of a government-run health care in Canada. It cites the resignation of a health minister due to public spending issues revealed by the province' Auditor General and examines how the scandal had wasted its resources on its eHealth Ontario and Smart Systems for Health Agency. It examines how the management of the country's health care system has been politicized and elected officials were influenced by political incentives.</ab>

        <ab>This article reports on telemedicine in India which is serving people in remote rural areas of the country by hooking them up to doctors via video conferencing. The government and private sectors are both investing in the technology to reach the undertreated population which is said to be as large as 70 percent of the country's total population. Many are concerned that the video conferencing cannot allow the doctor to make accurate diagnosis nor to care properly for the patient. Figures in India, where the system is most advanced, show that .15 million patients have used the method to get health advice but costs of the service are an issue for the poor patients.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports on the research findings released by the non-profit research Center for Information Technology Leadership (CITL) which show that provider-to-provider telehealth technologies can save $4.28 billion annually. CITL looked at three primary forms of telehealth including real-time video, store-and-forward, and a hybrid model of the first two. CITL concludes that the hybrid model is the most cost effective of the three with a potential yearly savings of $3.61 billion.</ab>

The unit features a blood pressure cuff for patients to test their vital signs, a stethoscope, a finger monitor to monitor oxygen saturation, and a scale. The purpose of the program is to reduce repeat hospital stays because hospitals do not get paid for these stays.</ab>

        <ab>In recent years, technology has been increasingly harnessed for motivating and supporting people toward various individually and collectively beneficial behaviors. One of the most popular developments in this field has been titled gamification. Gamification refers to technologies that attempt to promote intrinsic motivations toward various activities, commonly, by employing design characteristic to games. However, a dearth of empirical evidence still exists regarding why people want to use gamification services. Based on survey data gathered from the users of a gamification service, we examine the relationship between utilitarian, hedonic and social motivations and continued use intention as well as attitude toward gamification. The results suggest that the relationship between utilitarian benefits and use is mediated by the attitude toward the use of gamification, while hedonic aspects have a direct positive relationship with use. Social factors are strongly associated with attitude, but show only a weak further association with the intentions to continue the use of a gamification service.</ab>

        <ab>The digital divide is usually conceptualized through goods-dominant logic, where bridging the divide entails providing digital goods to disadvantaged segments of the population. This is expected to enhance their digital capabilities and thus to have a positive influence on the digital outcomes (or services) experienced. In contrast, this study is anchored in an alternative service-dominant logic and posits that viewing the divide from a service perspective might be better suited to the context of developing countries, where there is a huge divide across societal segments in accessing basic services such as healthcare and education. This research views the prevailing differences in the level of services consumed by different population segments (service divide) as the key issue to be addressed by innovative digital tools in developing countries. The study posits that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be leveraged to bridge the service divide to enhance the capabilities of service-disadvantaged segments of society. But such service delivery requires an innovative assembly of ICT as well as non-ICT resources. Building on concepts from service-dominant logic and service science, this paper aims to understand how such service innovation efforts can be orchestrated. Specifically, adopting a process view, two Indian enterprises that have developed sustainable telemedicine healthcare service delivery models for the rural population in India are examined. The study traces the configurations of three interactional resources—knowledge, technology, and institutions—through which value-creating usercentric objectives of increasing geographical access and reducing cost are achieved. The theoretical contributions are largely associated with unearthing and understanding how the three interactional resources were orchestrated for service-centric value creation in different combinative patterns as resource exploitation, resource combination, and value reinforcement. The analysis also reveals the three distinct stages of service innovation evolution (idea and launch, infancy and early growth, and late growth and expansion), with a distinct shift in the dominant resource for each stage. Through an inductive process, the study also identifies four key enablers for successfully implementing these ICT-enabled service innovations: obsessive customer empathy, belief in the transformational power of ICT, continuous recursive learning, and efficient network orchestration.</ab>

He says that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) think highly of telemedicine to reimburse physicians for treatments involving telemedicine technology. CMS encourages people to use the flexibility in federal law to innovate payment methodologies for services that incorporate telemedicine technology. He also stresses on the media's responsibility in such project.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on how most studies concerning health care costs in relation to the legitimization of telemedicine fail to recognize the advantages of the technology. According to telemedicine advocates, social science issues must be taken in consideration when assessing health care costs, including the cost of transportation, missed work and possible child-care expenses of the relatives or friends who accompany patients on long-distance visits to a physician. Telemedicine can offer convenience in accessing health care services as well as immediate medical attention during critical treatment periods that would otherwise be wasted on travel.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents the author's views on various advances made in the wireless technology that provide a vital link to enhancing telemedicine services. Telecommunications technologies are employed by the telemedicine to provide medical information and services by the way of secured communication channels. Whatever the conditions may be, it is required by the telemedicine systems to operate reliably at all the times in order to support mission-critical services. The reliable support of such a diverse range of services is only possible by having the appropriate quality assurance methodology and information security in place. Therefore, the advances in wireless networking technologies provide a vital link to enhancing telemedicine services.</ab>

        <ab>Electronic health (e-health) refers to the delivery of health care with support from various information and communication technologies, such as electronic health records, telemedicine, clinical decision support, and computerized provider order entry. E-health is considered by government, providers, and payers as a primary method of improving quality, safety, and costs associated with the delivery of health care. Although currently on a pedestal, ehealth has not been readily adopted by a majority of health care providers in the United States. To achieve greater adoption and use of technology in health care, the health care community needs a roadmap, or model for adoption, that can be used to develop a business case to lower risk for providers who adopt and use technology in clinical practice. This article suggests such a roadmap. The roadmap advocates for (1) greater dissemination of implementation best practices, (2) continued development of a strong e-health workforce, and (3) sustainable resources to help those seeking to adopt and use e-health technologies in clinical practice. The e-health community is invited to advance the roadmap to assist providers in embracing and utilizing information and communication technologies for health care system improvements.</ab>

        <ab>This paper addresses two key technological barriers to the wider adoption of patient telemonitoring systems for chronic disease management, namely, usability and sensor device interoperability. As a great percentage of chronic patients are elderly patients as well, usability of the system has to be adapted to their needs. This paper identifies (from previous research) a set of design criteria to address these challenges, and describes the resulting system based on a wireless sensor network, and including a node as a custom-made interface that follows usability design criteria stated. This system has been tested with 22 users (mean age 65) and evaluated with a validated usability questionnaire. Results are good and improve those of other systems based on TV or smartphone. Our results suggest that user interfaces alternative to TVs and smartphones could play an important role on the usability of sensor networks for patient monitoring. Regarding interoperability, only very recently a standard has been published (2010, the ISO IEEE 11073 Personal health devices) that can support the needs of limited computational power environments typical of patient monitoring sensor networks.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports on the study by the Center for Information Technology Leadership (CITL) regarding the benefits and costs of provider-to-provider telehealth technologies in the U.S. Result shows that robust telehealth systems which are nationally implemented in emergency departments (EDs), correctional institutions, nursing homes and physician offices could save as much as $4.28 billion annually. The report shows how technology can be used to improve access to care for medically underserved geographic areas and underrepresented medical specialties and how the benefits outweigh the costs to implement the systems. According to the 2004 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report, of the 20% of Americans living in the rural areas, only 9% of primary care physicians practiced there.</ab>

This telemedicine system could enable health services to reach island and remote communities around the country. The Scottish Centre for Telehealth is collaborating with National Health Services (NHS) Scotland to trial the HealthPresence virtual clinic system, which links patients and doctors through videoconferencing without the need for medically trained assistants on site. The system, developed by Cisco Systems Inc., is being evaluated by doctors at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. The system uses an IP network to combine high definition (HD) video and audio with medical information.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Healthcare, the largest industry in the United States, is in crisis, and threatens to bankrupt the nation''s economy. Medical errors kill an estimated 98,000 people per year, and accessibility to adequate healthcare is an increasing problem for much of the country''s citizenry. Despite being one of the most important keys to resolving this crisis, a national electronic healthcare network (eHealth) is under-appreciated and under-exploited, and faces several formidable barriers to implementation. Current and prospective national political leadership has focused narrowly on a subset of issues, in the belief that the crisis cannot be addressed holistically due to political interests. Yet the barriers that greatly impede eHealth''s potential to help solve the crisis can only be removed in a timely manner by a comprehensive, national framework that reshapes the legal, operational, and economic landscape for eHealth. Only a greater public awareness that encourages national legislative action can enhance eHealth''s potential to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare while reducing its cost.</ab>

        <ab>As consumer-oriented and technology-savvy patients converge on the changing health care market, asynchronous health care communication (AHCC) emerges as a strong growth driver for both telemedicine and e-health. Telemedicine and e-health both depend on communication technologies. Telemedicine is an established field that uses telecommunications to facilitate consultations between health care providers and remote patients and between specialists and primary care providers. E-health is a relatively new field that uses the Internet to deliver access to health care information and services and has been led primarily by entrepreneurs from outside the health professions. The term asynchronous health care communication (AHCC) describes interpersonal, computer-mediated communication (CMC) between providers and their patients for telemedicine and e-health functions. Communication increases patients' satisfaction with those providers and compliance with therapeutic regimens and it reduces patient stress and the risk of malpractice claims against providers.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on challenges related to the use of information technology in health care services. Some of the reasons of little or non-application of information technology in health sector is health is the complexity of medical data, data entry problems, security and confidentiality concerns, the absence in many countries of a unique national patient identifier and a general lack of awareness of the benefits of information technology. The pressure on the health care business to change is mounting. Efficiency and cost-effectiveness are two major driving forces behind this need to change with managed care in the U.S. The present inability to share information across systems and between care organizations automatically, that represents one of the major impediments to progress toward shared care and cost containment. There is need to take a more business process view of health care delivery and to identify the appropriate organizational and information infrastructures to support these processes.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents information on Partners HealthCare System Inc.'s telemedicine project. The new telemedicine system will extend care to many more patients than Partners HealthCare would have otherwise been able to treat. Partners HealthCare's telemedicine project is one example of how digital-imaging capabilities coupled with mobile connectivity have changed and improved processes in many industries. Real-estate professionals already use digital imaging to market properties and improve sales, but cameras on today's cell phones aren't high-quality enough for this purpose. Key to the telemedicine system's success is making the image transmission as accurate and as easy as possible for the field nurses, who don't want to be bogged down with manually resending images or keeping track of which images were successfully received.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on using telemedicine to bring medical care in Africa. It is made possible through the Mashavu Project by tapping the creativity and social activism of college students at Penn State. Several medical devices for Mashavu have been developed from the university's student team. Students have also created medical instruments that connect to personal computers (PC) so data can be sent to physicians at remote sites.</ab>

        <ab>The article highlights the view of health authorities that a rural telemedicine pilot program approved by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in 2006 should help many small community hospitals upgrade their information technology capabilities. The American Hospital Association report showed that more and more hospitals are tapping into information technology to share health records and clinical data. However, cost remains a problem, particularly for smaller facilities.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on the success of inpatient and outpatient telepharmacy services in North Dakota. Barbara E. Lacher of North Dakota State College of Science elaborates the important role of pharmacy technicians in the program. Accordingly, telepharmacy lets pharmacies offer oversight and expertise using video links. It mentions that North Dakota's telepharmacy began in 2001 which aims to extend pharmaceutical services to rural areas.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that at the telemedicine unit of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, videoconferencing has been a mission-critical application since 2000. But it now plans to move to a second stage with less-expensive but technologically superior cameras and software. Patients at more than 250 remote locations in Texas, as well as scientists at the South Pole that the UTMB treats under a contract with the National Science Foundation, can already use live video feeds to talk to doctors and show them injuries and other medical conditions. The UTMB uses videoconferencing hardware and software from Polycom Inc. The UTMB beta-tested the VSX 5000 in the spring and will spend up to $12.5 million to replace its existing models with the system over the next five years.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that physicians in the United States have been slow in adopting electronic prescribing and other technologies that do not immediately generate revenue or save time.

        <ab>The article discusses the success of the filmless environment implemented by Community Medical Centers. In 2004 the nonprofit hospital group migrated to a system that would let images such as x-rays, MRIs and ultrasounds traverse the networks so technicians, doctors and other medical staff from anywhere could gain access to them. The filmless environment program was called Picture Archival Computer System and was establisehd by the business applications unit of the company's IT department. IT officers reviewed the project requirements and assessed the existing network, identifying areas where additional resources would be needed.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Health care is in the midst of a consumer-oriented technology explosion. Individuals of all ages and backgrounds have discovered eHealth. But the challenges of implementing and evaluating eHealth are just beginning to surface, and, as technology changes, new challenges emerge. Evaluation is critical to the future of eHealth. This article addresses four dimensions of eHealth evaluation: (1) design and methodology issues; (2) challenges related to the technology itself; (3) environmental issues that are not specific to eHealth but pose special problems for eHealth researchers; and (4) logistic or administrative concerns of the evaluation methodology selected. We suggest that these four dimensions must be integrated to provide a holistic framework for designing and implementing eHealth research projects, as well as for understanding the totality of the eHealth intervention. The framework must be flexible enough to adapt to a variety of end users, regardless of whether the end user is a healthcare organization, a for-profit business, a community organization, or an individual. The framework is depicted as a puzzle with four interlocking pieces.</ab>

        <ab>This article reports that telemedicine systems have the potential to revolutionise healthcare by enhancing quality and efficiency through virtual access. To serve this goal, it is fundamental to understand the telemedicine encounter process. Researchers conduct this study from the position of the medical professionals who directly use the technology and are accountable for patient care. They discuss the derived quality attributes and identify opportunities for their control in terms of who can apply control and when the control is best applied.</ab>

        <ab>The Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa is a hospital that relies on wireless communication devices to more closely link its doctors and nurses. Mercy uses voice-activated badges from Vocera Communications Inc. Nurses wear the badges around their necks and use them to page doctors, call the pharmacy and respond to patients who press the call buttons in their rooms. With the badges, nurses can make and receive calls from any place in the hospital. They are no longer tied to the phones in the nurses' stations. Adopting the badges required Mercy to ensure that there was wireless signal coverage throughout the hospital. With Cisco's WLAN Solutions Engine, Mercy can measure the output of all access points.</ab>

        <ab>This article analyses the application of telemedicine technology towards benefiting the rural people. Telemedicine is one of the latest evolutions of information communication technology (ICT). Telemedicine can be used as an effective means of delivering quality healthcare to the rural people. The resource availability is comparatively less for healthcare to reach the rural masses. Telemedicine helps the rural people to get access to expert advice and reducing their health risks. Andhra Pradesh Vaidhya Vidhana Parishad, the supervisory body for all the government hospitals in Andhra Pradesh is spearheading the telemedicine implementation at 24 district hospitals with the help of Care and Apollo hospitals.</ab>

        <ab>Human activity recognition with wearable body sensors receives lots of attentions in both research and industrial communities due to the significant role in ubiquitous and mobile health monitoring. One of the most concerned issues related to this wearable technology is that the sensor signals significantly depends on where the sensors are worn on the human body. Existing research work either extracts location information from the activity signals or takes advantage of the sensor location information as a priori information to achieve better activity recognition performance. In this paper, we present a sparse signal-based approach to corecognize human activity and sensor location in a single framework. Therefore, the wearable sensor is not necessarily constrained to fixed body position and the deployment is much easier although the recognition difficulty becomes much more challenging. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we run a pilot study in the lab, which includes 14 human activities and seven on-body locations to recognize. The experimental results show that our approach achieves an 87.72% classification accuracy (the mean of precision and recall), which outperforms classical classification methods.</ab>

        <ab>The article highlights the research on the difference between telepharmacy and ePharmacy. The author stated that the research shows that telepharmacy is a technology and provides pharmacy services to isolated communities. Meanwhile, ePharmacy is an innovative concept associated with electronic transactions, ePrescription systems and decision-support systems and it is reinventing pharmacy's business model. Moreover, ePharmacy has proven to be successful in countries such as Australia and has been found to be promising enough to add another shade to the spectrum of eHealth.</ab>

        <ab>The phrase "the doctor will see you now" may soon mean something new. Pristine, a start-up out of Austin, Texas, has developed a telemedicine app for Google Glass that will let hospital staff send real-time audio and video to specialists, wherever they may be. Pristine cofounder Kyle Samani was working for a health-care IT company in early 2013 when Google announced the launch of Glass, which packs many of the functions of a smartphone into a sleek head-mounted device. He immediately saw Glass's potential for hospitals. "A hands-free computer in health care makes a lot of sense," Samani says. Doctors wouldn't have to worry about picking up bacteria by handling a tablet or typing on a keyboard, he says, and they could interact with their patients without turning away to enter data. "As soon as Google announced Glass, I started working on this," Samani says.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Little is known about effective eHealth recruitment methods. This paper presents recruitment challenges associated with enrolling African-American girls aged 8–10 years in an eHealth obesity prevention program, their effect on the recruitment plan, and potential implications for eHealth research. Although the initial recruitment strategy was literature-informed, it failed to enroll the desired number of girls within a reasonable time period. Therefore, the recruitment strategy was reformulated to incorporate principles of social marketing and traditional marketing techniques. The resulting plan included both targeted, highly specific strategies (e.g., selected churches), and more broad-based approaches (e.g., media exposure, mass mailings, radio advertisements). The revised plan enabled recruitment goals to be attained. Media appeared to be particularly effective at reaching the intended audience. Future research should identify the most effective recruitment strategies for reaching potential eHealth audiences.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: This paper describes the development process of an evaluation framework for describing and comparing web survey tools. We believe that this approach will help shape the design, development, deployment, and evaluation of population-based health interventions. A conceptual framework for describing and evaluating web survey systems will enable the developers of health interventions to identify, select, and use the most appropriate and relevant survey tools. The primary contributors included survey methodologists, computer scientists, informatician, technical communications specialists, educators, evaluators, clinical practitioners, and health services researchers, who together developed a comprehensive ontology to describe the electronic survey domain. This paper will describe the survey ontology development process and detail lessons learned in the creation of the web survey system evaluation framework.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on learning organizations with telemedicine. For the post-industrial society, the knowledge and information society, learning is an important activity. Two-thirds of the respondents thought that something more could be done in telemedical work to promote their own learning, which shows the clear potential for learning by telemedicine. To start working with telemedicine initial instruction seems to be sufficient; a more extensive training programme appears unnecessary. In future, with many applications of telemedicine implemented, healthcare organisations may become important arenas for learning and leaders will have to focus on learning.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on telemedicine implementation via distributed networks. With the increasing availability of telemedicine technology to rural communities, sustainability of newly established programmes is increasingly being tested. The hope is to increase the sustainability of this programme by not decreasing patient volume of the specialists who are currently practicing in the area. Over the coming years, the network is predicted to be sustainable and increasing in value to the community, by offering patients the choice of being seen via telemedicine either by their local provider, or by the physicians at the medical centre.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on human factors and ergonomics in telemedicine applications. The field of human factors strives to optimise the performance, efficiency, and safety of human-machine systems by obtaining a clear understanding of the cognitive, perceptual and motor capabilities and limitations of users and their environment. Human factors researchers and practitioners employ multiple methods to evaluate psychological, macroergonomic, and usability issues that face users, as well as to provide design recommendations to improve system efficiency. These methods include task analysis, qualitative research methods, usability analysis, and quantitative research methods.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on the utilisation and sustainment of telemedicine. Despite a general consensus that many healthcare needs can be addressed through telemedicine, most telemedicine systems remain under-utilised and provision of services are difficult to sustain. The article outlines five steps for establishing baseline utilisation and assuring long-term growth and sustainability along with field-tested techniques for achieving each. The scenarios presented are based upon three projects for which these techniques were applied. A case study approach is used to describe the real world application of these steps in building strategic alliances between an academic health science centre and three universities.</ab>

Despite Richard Granger's reassurances that the NHS' existing systems will be assimilated into future initiatives. The professor bases his fears on the fact that Granger's team is plundering his work and that of other health service technology leaders for ideas, yet it is offering them no clue as to how their expertise will be used in future projects.</ab>

They note that such treatments are infrequently delivered in both private and public sectors. The study authors identify the role of telemedicine in EBP delivery.</ab>

        <ab>The Internet has become widely adopted as a medium for health promotion and information. For consumers to take advantage of it in this capacity, they need to have a core set of abilities. These abilities have been identified as eHealth literacy, the skills "to find, evaluate, and apply health information from electronic sources and apply the knowledge gained to addressing or solving a health problem" (Norman and Skinner 2006b). Educators are increasing their efforts to improve eHealth literacy, particularly among adolescents (Skopelja, Whipple, and Richwine 2008), because they recognize that its core abilities can have significant health consequences (Wu et al. 2010). Such efforts are relevant to advertisers because an important but overlooked concern is that improved eHealth literacy might weaken young consumers' trust in commercial websites--even those that provide accurate and reliable information. One reason for this possibility is that a key eHealth literacy skill is to distinguish persuasive online communications from those that are intended to be informational and educational. For example, adolescent consumers may perceive that websites serving commercial purposes, represented by the ".com" label in the domain name, are less reliable and trustworthy as sources of useful health information compared to websites provided by government agencies (".gov"), non-profit organizations (".org"), or educational institutions (".edu") (Hansen, Derry, Resnick, and Richardson 2003). Such existing skepticism toward commercial websites may be exacerbated the more adolescents' eHealth literacy skills improve. However, this skepticism may be ungrounded because there may be no difference in the quality of health information between commercial and noncommercial websites (Kunst and Khan 2002). Another potential problem for the profession is young consumers' obliviousness to socially responsible advertising practices. Many studies on social responsibility in the fields of marketing, consumer behavior, and advertising have documented the detrimental consequences of consumer distrust of advertisers who wish to practice ethical marketing and corporate social responsibility (Pomering and Johnson 2009). To address these concerns, the current study pursues two aims: first, to determine how adolescents perceive the trustworthiness of commercial and brand websites as sources of health information; second, to analyze how their improved eHealth literacy affects their reliance on information provided by commercial websites. This study is informed by the Persuasion Knowledge Model, which provides a theoretical guide for understanding laypeople's perception about a message's persuasive intent and the cognitive defenses they put up against it. The model conceives these defenses as people's ways of "coping' with an overabundance of persuasive appeals in their lives (Friestad and Wright, 1994). As adolescents develop cognitive skills to evaluate health information online, one way they might cope with marketers' persuasive intentions is to develop distrust toward commercial websites. This study was based on an eHealth literacy intervention project among middle school students at a rural school district in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. An online survey was developed that integrated feedback from focus groups conducted in August 2009 with existing eHealth literacy measurements (Norman and Skinner 2006a). The pre-intervention online survey was then administered in January 2010 by the researchers during students' computer classes (N = 183). Survey results were used by the researchers (who had backgrounds in Internet literacy, health, and online education) to develop three eHealth literacy instructional modules, which were used in the school's computer classes. Following the completion of the modules, the post-intervention online survey was conducted in May 2010 (N = 182). The results show that the students considered commercial and brand websites to be the least reliable and trustworthy sources of health information in general, as well as in the specific contexts of physical activity and nutrition. In particular, well-known brand websites such as Gatorade, McDonald's, and CocaCola were considered less trustworthy than little-known or generic commercial websites. The reason may be that adolescents have preexisting perceptions that the main purpose of a commercial or brand website is not to inform them but to sell products for profit. Moreover, improvements in the adolescents' eHealth literacy heightened the probability that they would choose brand websites as the least reliable source of information. If adolescents maintain their strong cognitive defenses against brand websites' persuasive intent, eHealth literacy educators may find it difficult to improve their critical thinking skills as applied to new media. In this context, that improvement would involve the ability to evaluate information carefully and systematically, and not just by distinguishing websites with the .com label from others. These findings may discourage advertisers who wish to participate in consumer literacy initiatives or promote healthier lifestyles among children. They should also raise concern in light of the child obesity epidemic, as claims that food marketers are persuading children to eat unhealthy food continue to spread. Although some members of the industry willingly participate in consumer literacy programs and regulate themselves when it comes to targeting children, such initiatives are often viewed suspiciously as self-serving gestures. An abundance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature has documented this consumer suspicion of advertisers' motives for sponsoring and tying their brands to social causes (e.g., cause-related marketing). Such suspicion threatens to diminish the effectiveness of advertisers' CSR initiatives, as well as the general credibility of socially responsible advertising (Pomering and Johnson 2009). Nevertheless, some evidence suggests that if the industry makes proactive public service efforts, it can help regain consumer trust and approval (for several international cases, see Eagle 2007). Two limitations should be noted. First, the study\s generalizability is limited because it was conducted at a single school in the rural Midwest. Second, trust in commercial websites was evaluated strictly with respect to physical activity and nutrition information. Different patterns of results might possibly emerge if the research were conducted in a different social setting or if trust in commercial websites were evaluated for different topics. Because the Internet is an important a conduit for health information, eHealth and eHealth literacy have become critical areas in which consumers can improve their decisions about health. Advertisers could benefit from making authentic and sincere public commitments to improve the health and nutrition of adolescent consumers. Their development of informative commercial websites, though, needs to be supplemented by other socially responsible corporate practices</ab>

        <ab>While the field of digital inequality continues to expand in many directions, the relationship between digital inequalities and other forms of inequality has yet to be fully appreciated. This article invites social scientists in and outside the field of digital media studies to attend to digital inequality, both as a substantive problem and as a methodological concern. The authors present current research on multiple aspects of digital inequality, defined expansively in terms of access, usage, skills, and self-perceptions, as well as future lines of research. Each of the contributions makes the case that digital inequality deserves a place alongside more traditional forms of inequality in the twenty-first century pantheon of inequalities. Digital inequality should not be only the preserve of specialists but should make its way into the work of social scientists concerned with a broad range of outcomes connected to life chances and life trajectories. As we argue, the significance of digital inequalities is clear across a broad range of individual-level and macro-level domains, including life course, gender, race, and class, as well as health care, politics, economic activity, and social capital.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: In February 2002 the Health e-Technologies Initiative (HETI), a program office of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation®, was created to advance discovery of scientific knowledge regarding the effectiveness of interactive eHealth applications. This article is the introduction to a series of seven articles written by grantees of HETI which address challenges, lessons learned, and proposed solutions as researchers implement eHealth projects. From this body of work it is clear that the overall process of conducting evaluation research in eHealth requires careful and detailed planning, recognition of the heightened sensitivity of IRBs, and institutions around the electronic collection and communication of personal health information, and a combination of tenacity and creativity to address the inevitable thorny methodological challenges to eHealth research. Use of established guidelines to help standardize the evaluation process, where feasible, is recommended.</ab>

        <ab>Providing health information to older adults is crucial to empowering them to better control their health, and the information is readily available on the Internet. Yet, little is known about the factors that are important in affecting seniors' Internet search for health information behavior. This work addresses this research deficit by examining the role of health information orientation (HIO), eHealth literacy, and Internet knowledge (IK) in affecting the likelihood of using the Internet as a source for health information. The analysis reveals that each variable in the study is significant in affecting Internet search likelihood. Results from the analysis also demonstrate the partial mediating role of eHealth literacy and the interaction between eHealth literacy and HIO. The findings suggest that improving seniors' IK and eHealth literacy would increase their likelihood of searching for and finding health information on the Internet that might encourage better health behaviors.</ab>

The authors outline results from early feasibility tests to determine if the underserved would use CHESS. Distinctive behaviors of underserved populations who have used CHESS are reported with a focus on how online health information and computer-mediated support groups are used. The article then reports on how the underserved benefit from using CHESS. Best practice recommendations for recruitment and training the underserved are offered, and implications for closing the digital divide are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>The author argues that medical data derived from devices connected to the patient's body should be owned by that patient. Topics covered include the potential benefits of expert systems that have the ability to acquire physiological data from sensors, the difference between medical data and medical information, and the relationship of medical ethics to autonomy and non-maleficence.</ab>

        <ab>Public administration has to prepare itself to deliver fully integrated eGovernment services. This delivery often requires cooperation via business processes interoperability across two or more departments. In this context, public departments and agencies need to implement interoperability using enterprise architecture techniques to structure business processes, and service oriented models to achieve their integration. Thus, it's quite interesting to adopt enterprise architecture paradigm and techniques to analyse, track and control the evolution degree of processes interoperability from the existing "as-is" state to the future "to-be" state. The present paper proposes a periodic monitoring approach based on an assessment method which considers three main aspects of interoperation: 1. Potentiality, reflecting the preparation to interoperate. The objective is to foster interoperation readiness by eliminating barriers that may obstruct the interaction. 2. Compatibility, referring to interoperation implementation through adequate engineering process. It aims to study the relation between the external interfaces of processes and the surrounding environment in order to ensure effective interaction. 3. Performance efficiency, focusing on monitoring operational performance. It consists of the availability assessment of the communication infrastructure and the supporting system in general. It considers also end users satisfaction of interoperation in use. The proposed method supporting tool, (IMT) for interoperability monitoring tool, assesses interoperability degree periodically through five steps: (i) Delineating the scope of interoperation; (ii) Quantifying the interoperation potentiality; (iii) Calculating the compatibility degree; (iv) Evaluating the operating performance; (v) Aggregating the degree of interoperability. In addition to its capacity to track the evolution of interoperation degree in time, the IMT measures the required effort to reach a planned degree of interoperability. Finally, to better illustrate how to use the proposed interoperability monitoring approach, we present a practical example of integrated public eService. It's a citizen oriented eService proposed by a public hospital that offers special fees for persons covered by social security insurances. It includes government to business collaboration and government to government one.</ab>

        <ab>The proliferation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in healthcare service delivery has brought with it great advancements in this sector. This has created the concept of eHealth which is a relatively new concept in health care service delivery in most developing countries. According to previous research studies, ICT solutions are rapidly changing the way health organizations and stakeholders communicate with each other (Ouma and Herselman, 2008). Many people are using such communication technologies to communicate with others to gather information, with healthcare being one of the most important areas of such applications. It is therefore understandable that the value and importance of ICTs in health has increasingly been recognized world wide. The literature in innovation adoption notes that there are still inadequacies in identifying the factors that are crucial in promoting eHealth adoption in developing countries (Drury, 2005). Although, in Africa, the advent of eHealth has brought exciting opportunities to reduce or control the growing healthcare inequities, a lot still needs to be done in the adoption of these technologies (UNESCAP, 2007). In a developing country like South Africa, the disparity in the access to ICTs in healthcare service delivery is wide due to the dichotomous demography of first and second economies existing in this country. This has had a negative impact on the adoption eHealth technologies thus, suggesting that even though there has been an appreciation in ICTs in healthcare, very little has been done to ensure the adoption of such technologies. This paper, however attempts to ascertain such factors that determine adoption of ICTs in healthcare service delivery from both the management and patients' perspectives. Drawing from the theories of innovation adoption in healthcare service delivery, the paper argues for the need to examine eHealth service adoption factors in developing countries and provides recommendations on how to tackle the challenges to adoption. The paper will conclude by recommending further research on issues in a number of key areas that need to be resolved to improve upon the efficient use and adoption of ICTs in healthcare service delivery amongst developing countries. South Africa is used as a case in this paper.</ab>

        <ab>The idea of merging sensors with a textile framework was spawned by the TAM-Telesante company. It successfully incorporated electronic components to link the T-shirt with the outside world. Heart rate, respiratory rhythm, and cutaneous temperature are all recorded. Via the global system for mobile communications network, an electronic device then transmits the data to the doctor on duty in the specialized monitoring center. If that doctor wants to communicate with the patient, he or she can do so through a microphone-loudspeaker that is incorporated into the garment. If necessary, an ambulance can be quickly dispatched to the patient's location. The patient is easily found with the built-in Global Positioning System. To complete this project, the company faced many unusual issues.</ab>

        <ab>The Child Health Information Tracking Application (CHeITA) was developed as a mobile application to enhance information sharing for parents/guardians and to facilitate better collaboration with health care professionals. Currently, there is no standard, single process for tracking vital infant health information from birth weight to vaccinations in Ireland. Subsequently, this project was undertaken as a collaborative research project between a group of Nursing and Midwifery and Information Systems (IS) researchers to develop a mobile solution for capturing, storing and leveraging this information thus providing a single unified view of infant information which can be used to support health care professional decision making when the need arises. During this first phase of research, this mobile android application was built and made available to parents of infants less than one year allowing them to capture a full, complete and real-time instance of their child's health information. A qualitative questionnaire was then conducted in order to further understand if such an application would be used to manage this type of information in the future. CHeITA was positively received by the fifty-five study participants. However the lack of availability of infant data on a longer term basis was met with disappointment, as the mobile app was only supported for a short time period as part of the pilot study.</ab>

        <ab>Signal compression is gaining importance in biomedical engineering due to the potential applications in telemedicine. In this work, we propose a novel scheme of signal compression based on signal-dependent wavelets. To adapt the mother wavelet to the signal for the purpose of compression, it is necessary to define (1) a family of wavelets that depend on a set of parameters and (2) a quality criterion for wavelet selection (i.e., wavelet parameter optimization). We propose the use of an unconstrained parameterization of the wavelet for wavelet optimization. A natural performance criterion for compression is the minimization of the signal distortion rate given the desired compression rate. For coding the wavelet coefficients, we adopted the embedded zerotree wavelet coding algorithm, although any coding scheme may be used with the proposed wavelet optimization. As a representative example of application, the coding/encoding scheme was applied to surface electromyographic signals recorded from ten subjects. The distortion rate strongly depended on the mother wavelet (for example, for 50% compression rate, optimal wavelet, mean±SD, 5.46±1.01%; worst wavelet 12.76±2.73%). Thus, optimization significantly improved performance with respect to previous approaches based on classic wavelets. The algorithm can be applied to any signal type since the optimal wavelet is selected on a signal-by-signal basis. Examples of application to ECG and EEG signals are also reported.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents the author's perspective on the issues concerning physicians practicing telemedicine. These professionals also face problems with licensure, conflicting laws, and malpractice insurance coverage. An issue constitutes practicing medicine in some states without a license. A few states provide a form of limited licensure specifically for telemedical practices and national licensure.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports on the move of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to build a regional broadband telemedicine network under the Rural Health Care Pilot Program. It cites that the program, which involves the construction of electronic facilities in 42 states, aims to provide a more convenient and cost-effective patient-medical assistance in rural areas. According to FCC chairman Kevin J. Martin, the facility will maximize and improve quality-based public medical care.</ab>

        <ab>Providing health information to older adults is crucial to empowering them to better control their health, and the information is readily available on the Internet. Yet, little is known about the factors that are important in affecting seniors' Internet search for health information behavior. This work addresses this research deficit by examining the role of health information orientation (HIO), eHealth literacy, and Internet knowledge (IK) in affecting the likelihood of using the Internet as a source for health information. The analysis reveals that each variable in the study is significant in affecting Internet search likelihood. Results from the analysis also demonstrate the partial mediating role of eHealth literacy and the interaction between eHealth literacy and HIO. The findings suggest that improving seniors' IK and eHealth literacy would increase their likelihood of searching for and finding health information on the Internet that might encourage better health behaviors.</ab>

        <ab>Telemedicine traffic carries critical information with regard to a patients' condition; hence, it requires the highest transmission priority compared with all other types of traffic in the cellular network. The need for expedited errorless transmission of multimedia telemedicine traffic calls for a guaranteed bandwidth to telemedicine users. This condition, however, creates a tradeoff between the satisfaction of the very strict quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of telemedicine traffic and the loss of this guaranteed bandwidth in the numerous cases when it is left unused due to the infrequent nature of telemedicine traffic. To resolve this complex problem, in this paper, we propose and combine the following two techniques: 1) an adaptive bandwidth reservation scheme based on road map information and on user mobility and 2) a fair scheduling scheme for telemedicine traffic transmission over wireless cellular networks.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents a new supervised method for blood vessel detection in digital retinal images. This method uses a neural network (NN) scheme for pixel classification and computes a 7-D vector composed of gray-level and moment invariants-based features for pixel representation. The method was evaluated on the publicly available DRIVE and STARE databases, widely used for this purpose, since they contain retinal images where the vascular structure has been precisely marked by experts. Method performance on both sets of test images is better than other existing solutions in literature. The method proves especially accurate for vessel detection in STARE images. Its application to this database (even when the NN was trained on the DRIVE database) outperforms all analyzed segmentation approaches. Its effectiveness and robustness with different image conditions, together with its simplicity and fast implementation, make this blood vessel segmentation proposal suitable for retinal image computer analyses such as automated screening for early diabetic retinopathy detection.</ab>

        <ab>Process virtualization occurs when a process that relies upon physical interaction between people and/or objects is transitioned to a virtual environment. Process virtualization is having profound effects on society, as an increasing number of both business and nonbusiness processes such as those related to education, medicine, and dating are being migrated to virtual environments. There is a vast literature that relates to process virtualization topics, but it is fragmented across different domains. The purpose of this paper is to propose a research agenda to develop high-level theories and frameworks that inform the general process virtualization phenomenon. Developing these theories and frameworks will synthesize existing knowledge and provide a theoretical foundation upon which to add new knowledge as it is created. This will help policy makers maximize the substantial benefits of virtual processes while minimizing the risks. Given the background, interests, and skills of IS scholars, the IS discipline is well suited to lead in this endeavor.</ab>

        <ab>The article offers information on the high-end imaging diagnostic equipment used by the medical community in the diagnoses, treatment and monitoring of patients and their medical conditions. Portable patient monitors that follow the trend toward shorter hospital stays enable patients to recover at home without incurring unnecessary risks because they can notify the patient and report back to the hospital when there is a high-risk condition. Portable devices that communicate with a central office empower patients to better manage their own health. The telehealth-care is a medical equipment that connects to and uses a network used by patients and doctors in monitoring, alerting and taking direct medical action.</ab>

        <ab>The article offers information on the innovation and incorporation of virtual intensive care units (ICUs). It mentions that telemedicine applications supply tools which are essential for remote patient monitoring, disease management and home health care. It states that virtual ICU is one of the solutions to optimize clinical performance and at the same time manifests financial outcomes. It mentions that virtual ICU purchases technology to speed up critical care delivery through an onsite and remote model. Accordingly, one advantage of virtual ICU is that it affects the quality of clinical indicators. Moreover, organizations which use the virtual ICU in clinical areas have gained from advances in lessened redundancies, workflow processes and efficiency.</ab>

        <ab>Tracking Parkinson's disease (PD) symptom progression often uses the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) that requires the patient's presence in clinic, and time-consuming physical examinations by trained medical staff. Thus, symptom monitoring is costly and logistically inconvenient for patient and clinical staff alike, also hindering recruitment for future large-scale clinical trials. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate rapid, remote replication of UPDRS assessment with clinically useful accuracy (about 7.5 UPDRS points difference from the clinicians' estimates), using only simple, self-administered, and noninvasive speech tests. We characterize speech with signal processing algorithms, extracting clinically useful features of average PD progression. Subsequently, we select the most parsimonious model with a robust feature selection algorithm, and statistically map the selected subset of features to UPDRS using linear and nonlinear regression techniques that include classical least squares and nonparametric classification and regression trees. We verify our findings on the largest database of PD speech in existence (~6000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multicenter trial). These findings support the feasibility of frequent, remote, and accurate UPDRS tracking. This technology could play a key part in telemonitoring frameworks that enable large-scale clinical trials into novel PD treatments.</ab>

        <ab>In this commentary we reflect on the articles in this special issue on computer-mediated communication (CMC) "about things." We do this from our perspective as researchers of the sociotechnical practices of developing, using, and evaluating information technologies for health care work. The relevance of the articles for a medical setting is evaluated, and we also indicate that the material embeddedness of CMC should be "unpacked." By focusing on the materiality of CMC in its working practice, we can see the otherwise invisible work that performs the ecology needed to "make a CMC work." Only when seeing these activities, and when realizing the risks of possible miscommunications, can we assess the desirability and feasibility of (telemedicine) CMC projects.</ab>

        <ab>Wireless body area networks (WBANs) have received a lot of attention from both academia and industry due to the increasing need of ubiquitous computing for eHealth applications, the continuous advances in miniaturization of electronic devices, and the ultra-low-power wireless technologies. In these networks, various sensors are attached either on clothes, on human body or even implanted under the skin for real-time health monitoring of patients in order to improve their independent daily lives. The energy constraints of sensors, the vital and large amount of data collected by WBAN nodes require powerful and secure storage, and a query processing mechanism that takes into account both real-time and energy constraints. This paper addresses these challenges and proposes a new architecture that combines a cloud-based WBANs with statistical modeling techniques in order to provide a secure storage infrastructure and optimize the real-time user query processing in terms of energy minimization and query latency. Such statistical model provides good approximate answers to queries with a given probabilistic confidence. Furthermore, the combination of the model with the cloud-based WBAN allows performing a query processing algorithm that uses the error tolerance and the probabilistic confidence interval as query execution criterions. The performance analysis and the experiments based on both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate that the new architecture and its underlying proposed algorithm optimize the real-time query processing to achieve minimal energy consumption and query latency, and provide secure and powerful storage infrastructure.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives. We examined the acceptability, feasibility, and cost of a fully integrated online system (eSTI) for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, treatment, and linkage to care with 4 Northern California health departments. Methods. In April 2012, we implemented the eSTI system, which provided education; testing of self-collected vaginal swabs for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis; e-prescriptions; e-partner notification; and data integration with clinic electronic health records. We analyzed feasibility, acceptability, and cost measures. Results. During a 3-month period, 217 women aged 18 to 30 years enrolled; 67% returned the kit. Of these, 92% viewed their results online. STI prevalence was 5.6% (chlamydia and trichomoniasis). All participants with STIs received treatment either the same day at a pharmacy (62%) or within 7 days at a clinic (38%). Among participants completing follow-up surveys, 99% would recommend the online eSTI system to a friend, and 95% preferred it over clinic-based testing within a study. Conclusions. The fully integrated eSTI system has the potential to increase diagnosis and treatment of STIs with higher patient satisfaction at a potentially lower cost.</ab>

        <ab>The paper introduces numerical and experimental investigations of biotelemetry radio channels and wave attenuation in human subjects with ingested wireless implants. The study covers commonly used frequencies in telemedicine applications: ultrahigh frequencies at 402 MHz, 868 MHz and the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band frequency at 2.4 GHz. Numerical electromagnetic analysis is applied to model in/on-body radio propagation channels and the resulted parameters demonstrated the importance of digital phantom accuracy in characterization of wave absorption and attenuation with regards to organ contents, specifically for the digestion system, Path gain variations of biotelemetry radio channels, in the close vicinity of the subject, with wireless implants were measured using a near field scanner. Simulation results were verified with measurement in good agreement.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: We study a specialty hospital providing traditional face-to-face consultations by experts and telemedicine services by tele-specialists. As accuracy of diagnosis and treatment by tele-specialists are paramount in such a setting (unlike call center management), our main focus is to determine the optimal investment level in telemedicine technology with the trade off being between accuracy/quality and cost. Using a heuristic proposed in queuing theory, we provide the optimal investment in telemedicine technology together with the staffing policy, considering the various cost components, including staffing, technology investment, incorrect treatment, and waiting. The model also incorporates buy-in by the patients in the form of the arrival (show-up) rate dependent on the technology level established. We find that under certain conditions the hospital should not invest in telemedicine. Finally, we provide the optimal tele-specialist policy of the ratio of patients to treat via telemedicine and to refer to the face-to-face consultation. Our model also suggests that a policy of treating all patients via telemedicine is never optimal.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Broad adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) is a potential strategy for curbing healthcare cost growth, which is particularly vital for Medicaid. Despite limited evidence for EHR-related cost savings, the 2009 HITECH Act included incentives for providers to become meaningful users of EHRs. We evaluated a large Massachusetts EHR pilot to obtain early insight into the potential for the national strategy to reduce short-run healthcare costs in the Medicaid population. Methods: We calculated monthly ambulatory cost and visit measures from Medicaid claims data for beneficiaries receiving the majority of their care in the three Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative (MAeHC) pilot communities or in six matched control communities. Using a difference-in-differences of slope analysis, we assessed whether cost and visit trajectories differed in the pre-implementation period compared to the post-implementation period for intervention and control community members. Results: We found evidence that EHR adoption impacted ambulatory medical cost in two of the three communities, but the effects were in opposite directions. Ambulatory medical costs increased more slowly in one intervention compared to its control communities in the pre-to-post period (difference-in-differences=-1.98%, p&lt;0.001; PMPM savings of $41.60). In contrast, for a second pilot community, ambulatory medical cost increased more slowly in the control communities (difference-in-differences=2.56%, p=0.005; PMPM increase of $43.34). Conclusions: As a stand-alone approach, adoption of commercially-available EHRs in community practices did not consistently impact Medicaid costs in the short-run. This suggests that future meaningful use criteria may need to specifically target cost savings and coordinate with payment reform efforts.</ab>

        <ab>Institutional isomorphism has been a major intellectual contribution within institutional theory for three decades. The effects and processes of institutionalization have traditionally focused on stability and persistence of institutions, and more recently on institutional change. This study contributes to the IS field using the lens of coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphism and change within a highly institutionalized organizational field of health care. The setting is the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, where in 2002 a major government policy was launched to introduce Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to over 50 million citizens. Using episodic interviewing techniques and content analysis of government health IT policy documents, this study provides a longitudinal analysis of the introduction of government policy to modernize health care using information technology. Institutional isomorphic conditions become conflicted with attempts to impose field and organizational change. As clinicians attempt to retain their professional dominance in a climate of almost continuous restructuring of health services, political initiatives to implement EHRs are met with resistance from key stakeholders, resulting in policy changes and further delayed implementation times.</ab>

        <ab>The article introduces objective and research papers published in the June 2000 issue of the journal "Communications of the ACM." According to the editor, organizations realized the rich benefits of building, layering, and evolving their own unique information systems and application domains. The editorial board of this journal galvanised impressive group of experts to evaluate the information system integration problems and solutions from three different perspectives: business, application and technology.  In the research paper, "Is Telemedicine A Practical Reality?," Terry L. Houston and Janis A. Gibson discuss the new found appeal of telemetric as a result of the upheaval in managed healthcare. In the feature viewpoints, Richard Stallman presents an ardent plea for computing professionals to work feverishly to defeat the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act, while Tim O'Reilly takes on contention that current patent system is choking the innovation out of the Internet software sector.</ab>

        <ab>An increasingly aging population and spiraling health care costs have made the search for financially viable health care models an imperative of this century. The careful and creative application of information technology (IT) can play a significant role in meeting that challenge. Valuable lessons can be learned from an analysis of ten innovative telemedicine and e-health initiatives. Having proven their effectiveness in addressing a variety of medical needs, they have progressed beyond small-scale implementations to become an established part of health care delivery systems around the world. ©2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</ab>

        <ab>In a globalised networked economy, collaborative networks (CNs) are formed to take advantage of new business opportunities. Collaboration involves shared resources and capabilities, such as e-Services that can be dynamically composed to automate CN participants’ business processes. Quality is essential for the success of business process automation. Current approaches mostly focus on quality of service (QoS)-based service selection and ranking algorithms, overlooking the process of service composition which requires interoperable, adaptable and secure e-Services to ensure seamless collaboration, data confidentiality and integrity. Lack of assessment of these quality attributes can result in e-Service composition failure. The quality of e-Service composition relies on the quality of each e-Service and on the quality of the composition process. Therefore, there is the need for a framework that addresses quality from both views: product and process. We propose a quality of e-Service composition (QoESC) framework for quality assessment of e-Service composition for CNs which comprises of a quality model for e-Service evaluation and guidelines for quality of e-Service composition process. We implemented a prototype considering a simplified telemedicine use case which involves a CN in e-Healthcare domain. To validate the proposed quality-driven framework, we analysed service composition reliability with and without using the proposed framework.</ab>

        <ab>Reliable and high-performance resource scheduling for Virtual Machines (VMs) in cloud can guarantee the efficiency of remote rescue with telehealth system. When a local disaster, e.g. earthquake and tsunami, happens in a densely populated area, the surging health care demand leads to the increasing workload in Data Centers (DCs) by storing and delivering a mass of patients’ information and real-time physiology signals. However, the current self-adaptive scheduling methods cannot provide a high-accuracy recognizing of the two conditions: urgency or normal , which would procrastinate the system into a high-performance status, while the best rescue time is lost. In this paper, we propose a Primary Node -based architecture for typical telehealth service on cloud, which takes into account both storage and delivery efficiency. We also design a novel algorithm to predicting and allocating the future bandwidth of all VMs in the telehealth service context. This method is able to dynamically adjust each parameter of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) through collecting the historical information of the bandwidth workload. After we predict the future bandwidth consumption of VMs, a high-performance scheduling method is used to adjust the bandwidth to each VM for health care service. The simulation results prove that this algorithm provides a high-accurate prediction, which guides the allocating module to make decision before the request burst comes. Nevertheless, our algorithm improves the reliability of telehealth services for storing and delivering patients’ information among DCs.</ab>

        <ab>Several techniques have been developed during the last four decades for the compression of ECG signal. The ECG signal compression is required for two main reasons, effective and economic data storage and on-line transmission of the signal. However, in present information technology (IT) the ECG data compression has become more significant for Telemedicine. Hence, it is essential to review the existing direct data compression (DDC) techniques for the purpose of telemedicine. This paper deals with efficient algorithms which have been developed after carrying out an exhaustive study of methods such as amplitude zone time epoch coding (AZTEC), modified AZTEC, Fan and scan along polygonal approximation (SAPA) techniques. In each of these techniques, modifications have been made to make it suitable for telemedicine purposes. Suitability of the system has been checked over transport control protocol (TCP), internet protocol (IP), local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN). The techniques have been tested for all standard leads of ECG signal of CSE database. The results of improved direct data compression techniques are encouraging and promise wider scope for application in telemedicine.</ab>

        <ab>Although academic interest in the study of mobilities is on the increase, exactly what it takes and what it means for data to become mobile is seldom asked. This paper addresses that question for the case of digital medical images, more precisely mammograms (X-ray images of the breasts). It is argued that the kind of reasoning which treats mobility as a fixed asset of such images is problematic, because it obscures the particular perceptions, circumstances and practices that play a part in the accomplishment of medical images as mobile. The argument is based on ethnographic involvement with an e-Science/telemedicine research project aimed at demonstrating the benefits of a digital mammography database for breast cancer screening services, epidemiological research and radiology teaching in the UK. By focusing on the ways in which mammograms are re-presented as ‘mobile data’, and on how their movement is practically organized in the context of this project, the paper indicates a new direction for the sociological study of data mobility: one that understands the relationship between ‘data’ and ‘mobility’ as accomplished and emerging rather than fixed and inherent.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that, according to a study published this month in the journal "Archives of General Psychiatry," three quarters of all cases of chronic mental health disorders can be identified in patients by the age of 24. If mental health disorders are most commonly first diagnosed in adolescent and young adult patients, it must be asked why so few patient-facing pharmaceutical websites aim to specifically provide treatment and disease information to this population. One possible explanation is that pharmaceutical companies do not take the potential impact of the Internet to their bottom lines into serious consideration. However, current investments in online properties by the pharmaceutical industry suggest this is no longer true.</ab>

        <ab>The objectives of this article are to survey the benefits and challenges posed by the deployment and operation of wireless communications in support of healthcare networks. While the main advantage of wireless communications remains to provide ubiquitous connectivity, thus allowing greater physical mobility and interoperability, a number of engineering issues need to be addressed before this vision is realized. Our intent in this article is to explore some of these issues, including deployment, interference, and mobility, and provide insights for potential solutions.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: A body sensor network is a network of small sensor devices (biosensors) that sense health parameters of an individual, allowing 24/7 monitoring, providing biofeedback services. These networks have typically two layers: the sensor array and a sink node. The sink node manages the network, gathering sensor data continuously. However, raw sensor data is not enough to achieve biofeedback. One of the challenges body sensor networks present is the processing of raw biosensor data, in order to achieve a proper medical visualization of monitored parameters. This paper surveys some of the current approaches, proposes an interface classification based on features, and presents a solution based on a mobile device. The mobile application can run on a Java and Bluetooth enabled phone, allowing data retrieval, storage, and analysis in a single solution. The mobile application proposes a three-layer approach to BSN operation, adding the mobile device to the solution. The final system provides the user with a completely functional health-monitoring platform, which is easy to use and setup, validated through a complete series of tests on different mobile devices.</ab>

        <ab>Understanding the impact of service quality on economic and social outcomes is critical to extend the focus of IT service research. This study evaluates the impact of quality on both these dimensions in mHealth using a cross disciplinary approach. The conceptual model is rooted in the traditional cognition–affective–conation chain but explicitly incorporates convenience, confidence, cooperation, care and concern as the primary dimensions of mHealth quality. The model is validated in the context of a business-to-consumer mHealth services using partial least squares path modelling. The results confirm that service quality has both direct and indirect impact on continuance intentions (i.e. economic outcome) and quality of life (i.e. social outcome). In this relationship, satisfaction plays the key mediating role, whereas service quality does not have any moderating effect. Research implications point to scale and sustain this new healthcare paradigm by linking service quality to satisfaction, continuance intentions and quality of life.</ab>

The article also evaluates the problems in keeping patient confidentiality and privacy in a digital age. Examples of medical personnel outside a practice team who help in care for the patient are mentioned including physiotherapists and occupational therapists. It is considered appropriate to talk about medical issues with relatives who are acting as caregivers.</ab>

        <ab>The benefits of Pathways Housing First in addressing chronic homelessness for persons with severe mental illness have been well established. However, the implementation and effectiveness of such programs in rural areas has yet to be examined. We described the model's adaptations in Vermont, including the use of hybrid assertive community treatment-intensive case management teams, which consisted of service coordinators with geographically based caseloads (staff/client ratio of 1:20) and regional multidisciplinary specialists. The program's innovative and widespread inclusion of technology into operations facilitated efficiency and responsiveness, and a pilot telehealth initiative supplemented in-person client visits. The program achieved a housing retention rate of 85% over approximately 3 years, and consumers reported decreased time spent homeless, demonstrating that program adaptations and technological enhancements were successful.

        <ab>Objectives. We examined the social impact of the telemedicine intervention effects in lower- and higher-socioeconomic status (SES) participants in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) study. Methods. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine case management with usual care, with blinded outcome evaluation, in 1665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged 55 years or older, residing in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. The primary trial endpoints were hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure levels. Results. HbA1c was higher in lower-income participants at the baseline examination. However, we found no evidence that the intervention increased disparities. A significant moderator effect was seen for HbA1c (P = .004) and systolic blood pressure (P = .023), with the lowest-income group showing greater intervention effects. Conclusions. Lower-SES participants in the IDEATel study benefited at least as much as higher-SES participants from telemedicine nurse case management for diabetes. Tailoring the intensity of the intervention based on clinical need may have led to greater improvements among those not at goal for diabetes control, a group that also had lower income, thereby avoiding the potential for an innovative intervention to widen socioeconomic disparities.</ab>

        <ab>Context Telemedicine, the provision of health care at a distance, is arguably an effective way of increasing access to, reducing cost of, and improving quality of care. However, the deployment of telemedicine is faced with standards that are hard to use, application-specific data models, and application stove-pipes that inhibit the adoption of telemedical solutions. To which extent can a software ecosystem approach to telemedicine alleviate this? Objective In this article, we define the concept of software ecosystem architecture as the structure(s) of a software ecosystem comprising elements, relations among them, and properties of both. Our objective is to show how this concept can be used (i) in the analysis of existing software ecosystems and (ii) in the design of new software ecosystems. Method We performed a mixed-method study that consisted of a case study and an experiment. For (i), we performed a descriptive, revelatory case study of the Danish telemedicine ecosystem and for (ii), we experimentally designed, implemented, and evaluated the architecture of 4S. Results We contribute in three areas. First, we define the software ecosystem architecture concept that captures organization, business, and software aspects of software ecosystems. Secondly, we apply this concept in our case study and demonstrate that it is a viable concept for software ecosystem analysis. Finally, based on our experiments, we discuss the practice of software engineering for software ecosystems drawn from experience in creating and evolving the 4S telemedicine ecosystem. Conclusion The concept of software ecosystem architecture can be used analytically and constructively in respectively the analysis and design of software ecosystems.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Desk-based employees face multiple workplace health hazards such as insufficient physical activity and prolonged sitting.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to increase workday energy expenditure by interrupting prolonged occupational sitting time and introducing short-bursts of physical activity to employees' daily work habits. METHODS: Over a 13-week period participants (n=17) in the intervention group were regularly exposed to a passive prompt delivered through their desktop computer that required them to stand up and engage in a short-burst of physical activity, while the control group (n=17) was not exposed to this intervention. Instead, the control group continued with their normal work routine. All participants completed a pre- and post- intervention survey to estimate workplace daily energy expenditure (calories). RESULTS: There was a significant 2 (Group) × 2 (Test) interaction, F (1, 32)=9.26, p &lt; 0.05. The intervention group increased the calories expended during the workday from pre-test (M=866.29 ± 151.40) to post-test (M=1054.10 ± 393.24), whereas the control group decreased calories expended during the workday from pre-test (M=982.55 ± 315.66) to post-test (M=892.21 ± 255.36). CONCLUSIONS: An e-health intervention using a passive prompt was an effective mechanism for increasing employee work-related energy expenditure. Engaging employees in regular short-bursts of physical activity during the workday resulted in reduced sitting time, which may have long-term effects on the improvement of employee health.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that three quarters of mental health disorders are evident in patients by age 24 according to researchers from the Archives of General Psychiatry in the U.S. Despite the conventional wisdom regarding the vulnerability of the adolescent and young adults to mental health disorders, many are wondering why so few patient-facing pharmaceutical Web sites aim to specifically provide treatment and disease information to this population.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the new Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) that was imposed in Great Britain in April 2013 in Great Britain and the Directed Enhanced Services (DES) for general practices. The changes that have occurred since the introduction of the QOF and DES include an increase in the involvement of practice nurses. General practitioners (GPs) also realized the important role played by practice nurses in medical care.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives. We compared participant characteristics and abstinence outcomes of smokers who chose in-person or telephone tobacco dependence treatment. Methods. We provided the same treatment content to 7267 smokers in Arkansas between 2005 and 2008 who self-selected treatment modality; examined demographic, clinical, environmental, and treatment utilization differences between modalities; and modeled outcomes and participants' choice of modality with logistic regression. Results. At end of treatment, in-person participants were more likely to be abstinent than telephone participants, and smokers of higher socioeconomic status (SES) were more likely to be abstinent with telephone treatment than lower-SES smokers. Long term, modality had no effect on treatment outcomes. Higher-SES smokers and smokers exposed to more treatment content were more likely to achieve long-term abstinence, regardless of modality. Men and more recalcitrant smokers were more likely to choose in-person treatment; lower-SES, ethnic minority, and more dependent smokers were more likely to choose telephone treatment. Conclusions. Treatment; modality attracts different groups of smokers, but has no effect on long-term abstinence. Multiple treatment modalities are needed to provide treatment to a heterogeneous population of smokers. More research is needed to understand the influences on treatment choice.</ab>

        <ab>Modern healthcare's need for knowledge sharing and bridging the research–practice gap requires new forms of collaboration, in which clinicians of varying clinical and research expertise work together over geographical and organisational borders. To support such distributed communities of practice (CoPs), an understanding of their collaboration processes, outcomes, challenges and enablers is needed. The article examines these issues through a case study of a long-running CoP, the Swedish Oral Medicine Network (SOMNet). SOMNet's main form of collaboration is monthly telephone conference meetings centred on case consultations. Cases are submitted by the clinicians via a Web-based system. The methods used were interviews, observations, and a questionnaire. The work adds to previous research by studying a distributed CoP explicitly focused on supporting the transfer of scientific results from researchers to practitioners. We found that the regular meetings give a rhythm to the community. The centrality of cases means an immediate benefit for the submitter while the community is provided an authentic context for learning. SOMNet yields opportunities for help and learning for diverse expertise levels; the type of benefits is affected by the participant's degree of oral medicine knowledge and collaboration involvement. There are challenges in accommodating varying levels of expertise and encouraging those less experienced to participate. Enablers of the collaboration include the participation of experts, meeting facilitators and well-adapted ITs.</ab>

        <ab>Wearable health monitoring is an emerging technology for continuous monitoring of vital signs including the electrocardiogram (ECG). This signal is widely adopted to diagnose and assess major health risks and chronic cardiac diseases. This paper focuses on reviewing wearable ECG monitoring systems in the form of wireless, mobile and remote technologies related to older adults. Furthermore, the efficiency, user acceptability, strategies and recommendations on improving current ECG monitoring systems with an overview of the design and modelling are presented. In this paper, over 120 ECG monitoring systems were reviewed and classified into smart wearable, wireless, mobile ECG monitoring systems with related signal processing algorithms. The results of the review suggest that most research in wearable ECG monitoring systems focus on the older adults and this technology has been adopted in aged care facilitates. Moreover, it is shown that how mobile telemedicine systems have evolved and how advances in wearable wireless textile-based systems could ensure better quality of healthcare delivery. The main drawbacks of deployed ECG monitoring systems including imposed limitations on patients, short battery life, lack of user acceptability and medical professional's feedback, and lack of security and privacy of essential data have been also discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Despite major national investments to support the adoption of health information technology (IT), concerns persist that barriers are inhibiting that adoption and the use of advanced health IT capabilities in rural areas in particular. Using a survey of Medicare-certified critical-access hospitals, we examined electronic health record (EHR) adoption, key EHR functionalities, telehealth, and teleradiology, as well as challenges to EHR adoption. In 2013, 89 percent of critical-access hospitals had implemented a full or partial EHR. Adoption of key EHR capabilities varied. Critical-access hospitals that had certain types of technical assistance and resources available to support health IT were more likely to have adopted health IT capabilities and less likely to report significant challenges to EHR implementation and use, compared to other hospitals in the survey. It is important to ensure that the necessary resources and support are available to critical-access hospitals, especially those that operate independently, to assist them in adopting health IT and becoming able to electronically link to the broader health care system.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes a new microwave-based method and associated measurement system for monitoring multiple vital signs (VS) as well as the changes in lung water content. The measurement procedure utilizes a single microwave sensor for reflection coefficient measurements, hence the name “microwave stethoscope (MiSt),” as opposed to the two-sensor transmission method previously proposed by the authors. To compensate for the reduced sensitivity due to reflection coefficient measurements, an improved microwave sensor design with enhanced matching to the skin and broadband operation, as well as an advanced digital signal processing algorithm are used in developing the MiSt. Results from phantom experiments and human clinical trials are described. The results clearly demonstrate that MiSt provides reliable monitoring of multiple VS such as the respiration rate, heart rate, and the changes in lung water content through a single microwave measurement. In addition, information such as heart waveforms that correlates well with electrocardiogram is observed from these microwave measurements. Details of the broadband sensor design, experimental procedure, DSP algorithms used for VS extraction, and obtained results are presented and discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Mobile health (m Health) platforms offer a promising solution to some of the more important problems facing the current healthcare system. This paper examines some of the key challenges facing m Health with a focus on privacy and security issues. In the first part of the paper, the security engineering process is described, which can assist healthcare organizations in developing an architecture-level protection strategy that is compliant with privacy and security legislation and industry initiatives. In the second part of the paper, use cases are selected to illustrate the diverse security architecture contexts in which the protection strategy will be deployed, and to emphasize the importance of integrating security across these contexts. In the third part of the paper, industry and government security best practices are discussed, which can assist healthcare organizations in implementing security architectures to meet their specific privacy and security requirements.</ab>

        <ab>Health care providers remain uncertain about how they will fare financially if they adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems. We used survey data from forty-nine community practices in a large EHR pilot, the Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative, to project five-year returns on investment. We found that the average physician would lose $43,743 over five years; just 27 percent of practices would have achieved a positive return on investment; and only an additional 14 percent of practices would have come out ahead had they received the $44,000 federal meaningful-use incentive. The largest difference between practices with a positive return on investment and those with a negative return was the extent to which they used their EHRs to increase revenue, primarily by seeing more patients per day or by improved billing that resulted in fewer rejected claims and more accurate coding. Almost half of the practices did not realize savings in paper medical records because they continued to keep records on paper. We conclude that current meaningful use incentives alone may not ensure that most practices, particularly smaller ones, achieve a positive return on investment from EHR adoption. Policies that provide additional support, such as expanding the regional extension center program, could help ensure that practices make the changes required to realize a positive return on investment from EHRs.</ab>

        <ab>This article presents a comprehensive review of literature and practice on the measurement and evaluation of ICT impact in general and of selected public eServices (eGovernment, eHealth, and elnclusion), within the context of the Information Society paradigm. It calls for a sustained meta-level analysis, in which it is important to have a self-reflexive layer where we evaluate and measure how we evaluate and measure, and what the implications and the trade-offs are. The analysis justifies the call for reflexivity as a necessary step towards advancing our understanding of the impact of ICT within the Information Society domains observed. The article concludes presenting some possible ways of re-coupling the conceptual and technical dimensions of the measurement process and linking the production of measurement data more closely with impact evaluation causal models and hypotheses. It suggests that this could be achieved by refocusing on the micro level and stimulating a gradual micro-macro link through an intermediate (meso) level, which effects need to be described using different measurements and evaluation paradigms. In order to do so it is required to refine and test our theories and models to find out where it would be most feasible to scale up to the global (macro) level and to shape and inform the production of more valid measurement indicators for better informing evidence-based policy making in the Information Society.</ab>

        <ab>Despite the opportunities the health sector will offer as a result of the design and development of a technology infrastructure, the fact is that hospitals have been slow to adopt telemedicine technologies, largely because very few organisations are prepared to face this challenge. A possible explanation for the efficiency and effectiveness gaps of services provided by Hospital-in-the-Home Units (HHUs) may relate to the advantages and disadvantages of the knowledge processes that these units exhibit as a result of their different structural properties. This paper investigates the approaches that HHUs have used to update the knowledge of physicians and their members' knowledge of technology, and relates them to an unlearning context (UC) and improvement in the quality of health services. These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 55 doctors and 62 nurses belonging to 44 HHUs. The research findings suggest that the key benefits of a UC in HHUs are clear. It enables them to identify and replace poor practices and also avoids the reinvention of the wheel; it enables cost reduction by minimising unnecessary work caused by the use of poor methods and it enables improvements adopting new telemedicine technologies.</ab>

        <ab>In telephone nursing (TN), nurse-patient encounters are handled via telecommunications, reflecting new complexities and challenges in healthcare. Telenurses must demonstrate the ability to make critical decisions that are accurate, safe, supported by good policy administra­tion, and capable of producing good patient and healthcare outcomes without the benefit of seeing the patient. This study aimed to describe telenurses' perceptions of four role vari­ables-safe assessment, decision-making, practice standard, and satisfaction-and to analyze the relationships among them, nursing education, and TN experience. A descriptive corre­lational study was conducted with a convenience sample of 70 nurses (mean age = 43years; SD =11.7) and data from Telephone Nursing Perception and Demographic Questionnaires. Results revealed that most telenurses were comfortable with telephone assessments and prac­tice standard. Their confidence in making decisions was lower, but overall, they were highly satisfied with TN. Moderately to strongly positive correlations among the four role variables were also found. Results underscore the importance of understanding the role demands inherent in TN and providing appropriate planning and leadership interventions.</ab>

        <ab>This study assesses smokers' perceptions, motivations, and intentions towards using an SMS-assisted smoking cessation intervention in Australia, France, and Mexico through an extended technology acceptance model with mediating variables. Data was collected through online surveys. Results show that perceived usefulness and vicarious innovativeness predict use intentions for all three countries. Perceived ease of use is significant only for Mexico. Subjective norms are significant only for Mexico and Australia. Perceived monetary value and perceived annoyance are significant mediating variables for all three countries, whereas perceived enjoyment is significant only for Mexico and Australia. These results contribute to theory and practice.</ab>

        <ab>Objectives. We assessed the effect of a telemedicine model providing medical abortion on service delivery in a clinic system in Iowa. Methods. We reviewed Iowa vital statistic data and billing data from the clinic system for all abortion encounters during the 2 years prior to and after the introduction of telemedicine in June 2008 (n = 17 956 encounters). We calculated the distance from the patient's residential zip code to the clinic and to the closest clinic providing surgical abortion. Results. The abortion rate decreased in Iowa after telemedicine introduction, and the proportion of abortions in the clinics that were medical increased from 46% to 54%. After telemedicine was introduced, and with adjustment for other factors, clinic patients had increased odds of obtaining both medical abortion and abortion before 13 weeks' gestation. Although distance traveled to the clinic decreased only slightly, women living farther than 50 miles from the nearest clinic offering surgical abortion were more likely to obtain an abortion after telemedicine introduction. Conclusions. Telemedicine could improve access to medical abortion, especially for women living in remote areas, and reduce second-trimester abortion.</ab>

        <ab>Rural communities face tremendous challenges in accessing mental health and substance abuse treatment services. Some of the most promising advancements in the delivery of rural health care services have been in the area of telecommunication technology. These applications have the potential to reduce the disparities in the delivery of substance abuse and mental health services between urban and rural communities. The purpose of this inquiry was to explore the advances and uses of telecommunications technology, and related issues, in the delivery of mental health and substance abuse treatment services within rural areas. A review of the academic literature and other relevant works was conducted and the content was organized into four major themes: (a) advantages of telehealth and applications to rural practice, (b) barriers to implementation in rural practice, (c) utilization in rural areas, and (d) areas for further research.</ab>

        <ab>IT performance reporting provider Concord Communications Inc. is making a play for CIOs and line-of-business managers looking for a quick status check on the health of their IT services with its new eHealth Business Service Console (BSC). BSC, which draws its data and analysis from Concord's eHealth suite, provides an aggregated view of network, systems and application performance, as well as user response-time data, from the same source. The Marlboro, Massachusetts, company has created a simple console with red, yellow and green icons that display "the end-user experience" of an IT service to ensure that component-level failures that don't affect users are not highlighted, company officials said. BSC features a stock-ticker-like format for displaying specified IT services, which IT executives or line-of-business managers can click to drill down for more details. George Tillmann, CIO at Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., in McLean, Virginia, finds more useful is that each view provided by the console and the eHealth series of reporting tools comes from the same "definitive database" so that "you have the same data driving strategic decisions as [operational and management decisions]."</ab>

        <ab>Concord Communications Inc., following what officials say was a large uptick in voice-over-IP deployments earlier this year, will announce its first support for monitoring and reporting on VOIP. The Marlboro, Massachusetts, maker of performance reporting software will update its eHealth series of reporting tools next week to provide a version specific to VOIP traffic. eHealth Version 5.6.5 provides the ability to receive VOIP data and cost data bundled into the tool's console. The new VOIP option combines reporting of VOIP and quality-of-service (QOS) and integrates the telecommunications industry's mean opinion score, which gives a quantitative value on the quality of a voice call. For new customers looking to monitor and report on the data network, VOIP and QOS, typical installations will cost $150,000.</ab>

This issue of the Bulletin explores trust, security and privacy, SIG/IFP's focus for the Association's 2014 Annual Meeting. The controversial and timely topic of net neutrality is examined from a historical perspective. Federal efforts in the area of cybersecurity and the practical implications of its failures are detailed. The importance of digital reader privacy is raised, comparing legal privacy assurances and gaps for brick and mortar libraries with security of readers' personal data in the cloud. A look at eHealth literacy reveals how the digital divide negatively affects health for various populations.</ab>

        <ab>Fake medical Web sites have become increasingly prevalent. Consequently, much of the health-related information and advice available online is inaccurate and/or misleading. Scores of medical institution Web sites are for organizations that do not exist and more than 90% of online pharmacy Web sites are fraudulent. In addition to monetary losses exacted on unsuspecting users, these fake medical Web sites have severe public safety ramifications. According to a World Health Organization report, approximately half the drugs sold on the Web are counterfeit, resulting in thousands of deaths. In this study, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm called recursive trust labeling (RTL). RTL uses underlying content and graph-based classifiers, coupled with a recursive labeling mechanism, for enhanced detection of fake medical Web sites. The proposed method was evaluated on a test bed encompassing nearly 100 million links between 930,000Web sites, including 1,000 known legitimate and fake medical sites. The experimental results revealed that RTL was able to significantly improve fake medical Web site detection performance over 19 comparison content and graph-based methods, various meta-learning techniques, and existing adaptive learning approaches, with an overall accuracy of over 94%. Moreover, RTL was able to attain high performance levels even when the training dataset composed of as little as 30 Web sites. With the increased popularity of eHealth and Health 2.0, the results have important implications for online trust, security, and public safety.</ab>

        <ab>Country experiences in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Taiwan, and UK have been in favor of telehealth services since the early 1990s. Though a few studies do discuss evidence of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of telehealth programs, the literature might limit to financial evaluation. This research investigates the welfare implications of conventional in-person and telecommunications health care as improving health levels or preventing health from deterioration for efficient resource allocation by incorporating government intervention for equal accessibility of health care in the economic progress perspective. Analytical findings indicate that the inverse U shape relationship between telehealth expenditure share and social welfare status exists as the nonlinear nexus between telehealth expenditure share and economic growth presents. The health dividend in terms of an enhanced economic growth rate can be achieved only when the initial share of telehealth expenditure is smaller than the growth-maximizing share. For economic sustainable development, telehealth initiatives strengthen rather than compete with conventional in-person health care. Research results guide the countries, which have or will have telehealth systems, for effectively allocating medical resources to stimulate economic growth and improve the population's well-being.</ab>

        <ab>Millennium Development Goals point out the necessity of actively promoting maternal-child health care status, especially in underserved areas. This article details the development actions carried out between 2008 and 2011 in some rural communities of Nicaragua with the aim to provide a low-cost tele-health communication service. The service is managed by the health care center of Cusmapa, which leads the program and maintains a communication link between its health staff and the health brigades of 26 distant communities. Local agents can use the system to report urgent maternal-child health care episodes to be assessed through WiMAX-WiFi voice and data communications attended by two physicians and six nurses located at the health care center . The health and nutritional status of the maternal-child population can be monitored to prevent diseases, subnutrition, and deaths. The action approach assumes the fundamentals of appropriate technology and looks for community-based, sustainable, replicable, and scalable solutions to ensure future de- ployments according to the strategies of the United Nations.</ab>

        <ab>The last few years have witnessed a revival of Indo-African technoeconomic cooperation within a host of ICT-based projects aimed at promoting capacity-building. This article is an attempt at sketching out some of the most significant traits of this evolving trend based on a discussion of two landmark initiatives: the Indian Technical and Economic Co-operation scheme and the Pan-African e-Network Project. The article suggests that differences between these two projects typify key changes that have taken place in conceptualizations of cooperation. First, there was an ethico-political shift in relation to the responsibility of the state and of individual beneficiaries. Then, the spatiality of cooperation has been modified in ways that are epitomized by the image of the network and its concomitant ideal of horizontal dispersion. Finally, a dynamic has emerged in which connecting the world and igniting the pride of the nation feed into one another in innovative ways.</ab>

        <ab>This work introduces an evaluation model for examining organisations that in one form or another depend on modern information technology for their core activities. The evaluation model, named SUV, is based on a systems science approach and has been developed at the eHealth Institute (eHälsoinstitutet) at the University of Kalmar. The central mechanism of the model, the SUV diagram, partitions the scope of evaluation into seven categories and three levels. The seven categories have been selected on a systems science basis with inspiration from systems thinking. The rationale for making this the starting point for the evaluation model is that it may be justifiably stated that the framework provided by systems thinking truly encompasses the breadth of human activity. Making use of this general framework, the SUV diagram provides a general roadmap to guide the evaluation effort. The three levels (organisation, technological and individual) were selected to add detail to the analysis complement the categories and enrich the analysis of each category as well as to the dynamic interplay among them. The SUV methodology is based on a continuous evaluation process whose driving-force is the wish of the interested parties to develop their own activities. It is a methodology within whose framework any and all methods for data gathering deemed appropriate for the evaluation at hand can be used. The use of multiple methods is explicitly encouraged for the purpose of gaining a multi-perspective view of the organisation/activity under scrutiny. Based on the accumulated findings from pilot studies, the model was operationalised in the form of an IT application for electronic surveys. The application is expected to contribute in making the evaluation process more efficient and add structure to this process.</ab>

        <ab>North Dakota's state-funded Dementia Care Services Program provides individualized assistance to caregivers of persons with dementia. Caregivers can contact program representatives at any time and may continue to contact them throughout the years they are caring for the person with dementia. During the program's first forty-two months of operation (January 2010 to June 2013), care consultants assisted 1,750 caregivers, primarily family members, of 951 persons with dementia. In survey responses and other self-reported data, the unpaid caregivers credited the assistance program with helping them feel more empowered, consider their charges less likely to be placed in long-term care, and use less potentially avoidable medical services such as hospitalizations and 911 calls. The program's estimated potential savings were $39.2 million from delayed long-term care placement and $0.8 million from reduced use of medical services, and its two-year costs were $1.2 million. The program's success with its rural service population, for which travel tends to be difficult and resources limited, provides a model for others to adapt. It also encourages further research on impacts of individualized support programs on persons with dementia and their caregivers.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: This pilot study aimed to determine the feasibility of a novel, low-cost program to get remote schools started in gardening and nutrition activities, for a lower cost than existing models, and without on-the-ground horticultural support. Methods: A multi-site, mixed methods case study was undertaken, in which four remote schools were shipped gardening materials and a nutrition and cooking resource, and provided with horticultural support by phone and email. A support register and teacher surveys were used for four months of evaluation. Results: The study demonstrated that the program is feasible, and may be associated with an increase from baseline in student's time spent cooking, gardening and on related classroom activities. Conclusions: The program was delivered economically without the need for on-the-ground staff, in a manner that was acceptable to teachers. Implications: This model may have application in remote schools throughout Australia, where there is a need to alter health impacting behaviours in high-risk populations. Lengthier program evaluation times and further resource development may be worth investigating in the future.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To assess the relative cost-effectiveness of various non-television advertising media in encouraging 25-39 year-old male smokers to respond to a cessation-related call to action. Information about how new electronic media compare in effectiveness is important to inform the implementation of future tobacco control media campaigns. Methods: Two testimonial advertisements featuring members of the target group were developed for radio, press and online media. Multiple waves of media activity were scheduled over a period of seven weeks, including an initial integrated period that included all three media and subsequent single media phases that were interspersed with a week of no media activity. The resulting Quit website hits, Quitline telephone calls, and registrations to online and telephone counselling services were compared to advertising costs to determine the relative cost-effectiveness of each media in isolation and the integrated approach. Results: The online-only campaign phase was substantially more cost-effective than the other phases, including the integrated approach. Conclusions: This finding is contrary to the current assumption that the use of a consistent message across multiple media simultaneously is the most cost-effective way of reaching and affecting target audiences. Implications: Online advertising may be a highly cost-effective channel for low-budget tobacco control media campaigns.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: This paper discusses measurement issues related to the evaluation of computer-tailored health behavior change programs. As the first generation of commercially available tailored products is utilized in health promotion programming, programmers and researchers are becoming aware of the unique challenges that the evaluation of these programs presents. A project is presented that used an online tailored health behavior assessment (HBA) in a worksite setting. Process and outcome evaluation methods are described and include the challenges faced, and strategies proposed and implemented, for meeting them. Implications for future research in tailored program development, implementation, and evaluation are also discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: In preparation for an electronic mail (e-mail) and web-based health promotion intervention across multiple worksites, secure, regulatory-compliant, user-friendly e-mail and Internet applications were used to recruit potential participants across worksites, to enroll participants, and to collect baseline health assessment data. Specific hardware and software information technology environments were required of the 19 participating worksites. Sequential e-mails introduced the study and invited participation. Twenty-four percent of all employees (1106 of approximately 4600) provided consent. E-mail delivered a web link for the baseline study assessment, and reminder e-mails were sent to prompt completion. Of those who consented, 888 (80%) completed baseline health and behavior data surveys. An HTML-native web survey software was more stable across computing environments. Using e-mail and web assessment, this research recruited, enrolled, and collected data from more than 850 participants. Technical and operational challenges emerged at each step. Solutions and recommendations are discussed. Overall, this experience suggests that the use of e-mail and web software can facilitate recruitment, enrollment, and data acquisition through direct contact with study participants. This experience yields a series of lessons learned for using e-mail and the Internet to support multi-site trials.</ab>

        <ab>Advances in information and communications technology have made possible collaborative activities in virtual settings. Virtual settings can significantly expand the knowledge resources available, yet they also create additional challenges to the already difficult activities of collaborating. The purpose of this research is to provide a better understanding of how collaborative activities in virtual settings enable the different parties to achieve their desired objectives by examining them from a knowledge management perspective. Three aspects of knowledge management—knowledge transfer, knowledge discovery, and knowledge creation—are examined in the context of telemedicine projects. The findings indicate that an association exists between the types of collaborative activities engaged in virtual settings and the effects such projects are perceived as having. While this research focuses only on virtual collaborative activities in health care, it is likely that these findings are applicable to other industries engaged in such activities in virtual settings.</ab>

        <ab>Rural residents in need of health care face many challenges. In 2009 the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust created the Rural Healthcare Program to improve access to and quality of care in areas of the upper Midwest challenged by health care workforce shortages and low population density. The program has focused its efforts on telehealth in seven upper Midwestern states. Since 2009 the Rural Healthcare Program has approved $22 million in grants to eighty-five rural hospitals to implement eEmergency services. The service's videoconferencing technology connects rural emergency department staff with emergency physicians and nurses located at the service's "hub." Initial analyses indicate that eEmergency has helped participating rural hospitals increase patients' access to specialists, increase the use of evidence-based treatment, decrease time to transfer a patient to a facility able to provide a higher level of care, and reduce unnecessary patient transfers. This article describes the health care challenges rural communities face and the telehealth projects supported by the Helmsley Trust's Rural Healthcare Program.</ab>

        <ab>Even with the best health care available, patients with chronic illnesses typically spend no more than a few hours a year in a health care setting, while their outcomes are largely determined by their activities during the remaining 5,000 waking hours of the year. As a widely available, low-cost technology, mobile phones are a promising tool to use in engaging patients in behavior change and facilitating self-care between visits. We examined the impact of a six-month mobile health (mHealth) demonstration project among adults with diabetes who belonged to an academic medical center's employee health plan. In addition to pre-post improvements in glycemic control (p = 0.01) and patients' satisfaction with overall care (p = 0.04), we observed a net cost savings of 8.8 percent. Those early results suggest that mHealth programs can support health care organizations' pursuit of the triple aim of improving patients' experiences with care, improving population health, and reducing the per capita cost of health care.</ab>

        <ab>Tele-emergency services provide immediate and synchronous audio/video connections, most commonly between rural low-volume hospitals and an urban "hub" emergency department. We performed a systematic literature review to identify tele-emergency models and outcomes. We then studied a large tele-emergency service in the upper Midwest. We sent a user survey to all seventy-one hospitals that used the service and received 292 replies. We also conducted telephone interviews and site visits with ninety clinicians and administrators at twenty-nine of these hospitals. Participants reported that tele-emergency improves clinical quality, expands the care team, increases resources during critical events, shortens time to care, improves care coordination, promotes patient-centered care, improves the recruitment of family physicians, and stabilizes the rural hospital patient base. However, inconsistent reimbursement policy, cross-state licensing barriers, and other regulations hinder tele-emergency implementation. New value-based payment systems have the potential to reduce these barriers and accelerate tele-emergency expansion.</ab>

        <ab>Hospitalizations of nursing home residents are frequent and result in complications, morbidity, and Medicare expenditures of more than a billion dollars annually. The lack of a physician presence at many nursing homes during off hours might contribute to inappropriate hospitalizations. Findings from our controlled study of eleven nursing homes provide the first indications that switching from on-call to telemedicine physician coverage during off hours could reduce hospitalizations and therefore generate cost savings to Medicare in excess of the facility's investment in the service. But those savings were evident only at the study nursing homes that used the telemedicine service to a greater extent, compared to the other study facilities. Telemedicine service providers and nursing home leaders might need to take additional steps to encourage buy-in to the use of telemedicine at facilities with such services. At the same time, closer alignment of the stakeholders that bear the costs of telemedicine and those that might realize savings because of its use could offer further incentives for the adoption of telemedicine.</ab>

        <ab>Arkansas's telemedicine system has evolved since 2003 from a support mechanism for high-risk pregnancy consultations to an initiative that spans medical specialties, including asthma care, pediatric cardiology, gynecology, and mental health. The system has also expanded care to diverse populations, including incarcerated women and people with HIV/AIDS. This article describes the system's evolution, organization, and diverse activities. It also shows how telemedicine can have a positive impact on a rural state and how such a state can become an engine for change regionally. The Arkansas telemedicine system faced classic challenges to uptake and function, in building and sustaining funding, in obtaining insurance reimbursement for services, and in educating patients and providers. The system's impacts on health outcomes and medical practice culture have also reached beyond patient care and provider support. The existing yet continually evolving telemedicine infrastructure and partnerships in Arkansas will respond to the state's inevitable health care reform adaptations from the Affordable Care Act and could provide direction for other states seeking to adopt or expand their telemedicine efforts.</ab>

        <ab>Despite the potential benefits of telehealth applications, little is known about their overall impact on care. This is critical because rising health care costs and a shortage of primary care providers make it likely that telehealth services will play an increasingly important role in health care delivery. To help fill this gap in knowledge, we describe early experiences with Teladoc, one of the largest telemedicine providers in the United States, which provides care directly to patients over the telephone or via the Internet. We analyzed claims data for a large California agency serving public employees that recently offered Teladoc as a covered service. The 3,701 Teladoc "visits" we studied were for a broad range of diagnostic categories, the most common of which were acute respiratory conditions, urinary tract infections, and skin problems. Compared to patients who visited a physician's office for a similar condition, adult Teladoc users were younger and less likely to have used health care before the introduction of Teladoc. Patients who used Teladoc were less likely to have a follow-up visit to any setting, compared to those patients who visited a physician's office or emergency department. Teladoc appears to be expanding access to patients who are not connected to other providers. Future research should assess the impact of Teladoc and other telehealth interventions on the quality and cost of care.</ab>

        <ab>The success of telehealth could be undermined if serious privacy and security risks are not addressed. For example, sensors that are located in a patient's home or that interface with the patient's body to detect safety issues or medical emergencies may inadvertently transmit sensitive information about household activities. Similarly, routine data transmissions from an app or medical device, such as an insulin pump, may be shared with third-party advertisers. Without adequate security and privacy protections for underlying telehealth data and systems, providers and patients will lack trust in the use of telehealth solutions. Although some federal and state guidelines for telehealth security and privacy have been established, many gaps remain. No federal agency currently has authority to enact privacy and security requirements to cover the telehealth ecosystem. This article examines privacy risks and security threats to telehealth applications and summarizes the extent to which technical controls and federal law adequately address these risks. We argue for a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for telehealth, developed and enforced by a single federal entity, the Federal Trade Commission, to bolster trust and fully realize the benefits of telehealth.</ab>

        <ab>Telehealth is widely believed to hold great potential to improve access to, and increase the value of, health care. Gaining a better understanding of why some hospitals adopt telehealth technologies while others do not is critically important. We examined factors associated with telehealth adoption among US hospitals. Data from the Information Technology Supplement to the American Hospital Association's 2012 annual survey of acute care hospitals show that 42 percent of US hospitals have telehealth capabilities. Hospitals more likely to have telehealth capabilities are teaching hospitals, those equipped with additional advanced medical technology, those that are members of a larger system, and those that are nonprofit institutions. Rates of hospital telehealth adoption by state vary substantially and are associated with differences in state policy. Policies that promote private payer reimbursement for telehealth are associated with greater likelihood of telehealth adoption, while policies that require out-of-state providers to have a special license to provide telehealth services reduce the likelihood of adoption. Our findings suggest steps that policy makers can take to achieve greater adoption of telehealth by hospitals.</ab>

        <ab>"Telehealth" refers to the use of electronic services to support a broad range of remote services, such as patient care, education, and monitoring. Telehealth must be integrated into traditional ambulatory and hospital-based practices if it is to achieve its full potential, including addressing the six domains of care quality defined by the Institute of Medicine: safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. Telehealth is a disruptive technology that appears to threaten traditional health care delivery but has the potential to reform and transform the industry by reducing costs and increasing quality and patient satisfaction. This article outlines seven strategies critical to successful telehealth implementation: understanding patients' and providers' expectations, untethering telehealth from traditional revenue expectations, deconstructing the traditional health care encounter, being open to discovery, being mindful of the importance of space, redesigning care to improve value in health care, and being bold and visionary.</ab>

        <ab>With the advent of national health reform, millions more Americans are gaining access to a health care system that is struggling to provide high-quality care at reduced costs. The increasing adoption of electronic technologies is widely recognized as a key strategy for making health care more cost-effective. This article examines the concept of connected health as an overarching structure for telemedicine and telehealth, and it provides examples of its value to professionals as well as patients. Policy makers, academe, patient advocacy groups, and private-sector organizations need to create partnerships to rapidly test, evaluate, deploy, and pay for new care models that use telemedicine.</ab>

        <ab>Mental illness imposes a staggering public health burden in the United States. Although the past 40 years have witnessed tremendous advances in the identification of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in psychological treatments, gaps persist between treatment in experimental settings and services available in the community. In response, considerable attention and large financial commitments have focused in recent years on broad dissemination and implementation efforts designed to improve the quality of psychological services delivered by a variety of generalist practitioners across practice settings. Increasingly, under the influence of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it is envisioned that these generalists will practice in integrated primary care settings. These advances hold enormous potential, and yet, given the tremendous diversity of mental health problems and human suffering, broad dissemination and implementation efforts to generalists alone may not be sufficient to adequately address the burden of mental illness. Some EBPs may prove too complex for universal dissemination, and the time and expense required for quality dissemination and implementation preclude large-scale training in the treatment of low base rate disorders. As dissemination and implementation efforts work to ensure a quality generalist mental health care workforce, herein we highlight the vital need for available specialty care in the delivery of psychological treatments. Given traditional barriers that interfere with the accessibility of specialty care, we propose the transformative potential of a specialty behavioral telehealth care workforce, transacting with the generalist practitioner workforce to collectively ensure the highest quality and timely delivery of needed treatments to affected individuals.</ab>

        <ab>E-health is concerned with promoting the health and wellbeing of individuals, families and communities, and improving professional practice through the use of information management and information and communication technology. In autumn 2010 the RCN, supported by an information technology consultancy, carried out a survey of members' views on e-health to assess their involvement in, and readiness for, e-health developments and their knowledge of its benefits. A total of 1,313 nurses, midwives, healthcare support workers and pre-registration students from across the UK responded. This article describes ways in which nurse managers can influence the successful implementation of the survey recommendations.  INSET: UK programmes for IT and e-health.</ab>

        <ab>Internet-based telemedicine is becoming an effective tool to deliver home-healthcare services and health information on demand, especially in rural areas, where there is often a large elderly population with greater rates of preventable chronic diseases. However, the designs of current interfaces for these internet-based telemedicine systems do not take elderly user characteristics into consideration. This study conducted usability testing on the interface of an internet-based telemedicine system using two different age groups, young adults and older adults. Differences in overall performance and satisfaction between the two groups were identified. Based on these results, a future direction is suggested for the interfaces of internetbased telemedicine systems.</ab>

        <ab>Telemedicine has emerged as an effective tool for providing high quality healthcare service and health-related information, especially in rural areas. Rural areas often have a larger elderly population with greater rates of preventable disease. These areas also have fewer medical resources and specialists, and have limited access to health services, all of which can influence overall health. An internet-based telemedicine system can be one solution to provide the rural elderly with the proper health information when needed. The elderly obviously have limited capabilities compared with younger adults in the use of internet technology. However, the interfaces of the currently existing internet-based telemedicine systems are not specifically developed for elderly users. This paper suggests future interface design research for an internet-based telemedicine system specifically for the elderly.</ab>

        <ab>This paper utilized a user-centered design approach as the foundation for technology in dementia care in order to improve the quality of telemedicine service. A status-quo analysis and questionnaire survey were conducted to explore the actual needs of the elders in using the lost seeking devices and the problems they encountered. In total, 37 caregivers for people with dementia were surveyed (20 female, 17 male, M = 50.08, SD = 15.47). The dementia-patients: 16 are male, 21 female (M = 72.75, SD = 10.23). Through analysis and induction, 3 problems were identified: poor information transmission, low user acceptance, individual material security anxiety. 2-4 improvement proposals are suggested for each problem. Most care-givers hope technological products would increase the efficiency and safety, but they also think it's too expensive and lack of computer skills. This result demonstrates the choice of seeking methods depends on the education level of the caregivers and most of them are elders. The concern of data leakage is also related to today's fraud issue, which may be the reason limiting the promotion of electronic products and biometrics. Further research is required, suggesting researchers should pursue improvements in lost seeking design devices in dementia for caregivers.</ab>

        <ab>Current industrial processes often involve the collaboration of people at distant and remote locations. The technological media for such a tele-cooperation reach from simple email or text-based chatting systems to highly-sophisticated systems for an interactive video-conferencing. But with limited bandwidth the communication between persons at distant locations is often restricted to single modalities. Although this may still be suitable for some tasks, it may result into serious shortcomings and decreased performance with complex tasks like cooperative assembly or maintenance. This is because restricted communication reduces the availability of a common ground, i.e. sharing a common understanding of knowledge, opinions, and goals. The study presented in this paper examines the effect of different communication media on performance of a collaborative assembly task. The results show that tele-cooperation leads to additional verbal communication (AM(direct)=71.1s; AM(video)=145.6s; AM(audio)=204.7s) and, thus, longer times to complete the task (AM (direct)=45.95 min; AM (video)= 50.2 min; am AM(audio)=56.16 min). The percentage of relative speech duration also increases significantly. Workload measurement with NASA-TLX did not show any significant differences between cooperation modes. The results allow estimating the effect of reduced communication modalities on time to complete an assembly task. This facilitates a quantification of temporal requirements in time-critical maintenance and repair tasks.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we present an original environment, the Distributed Collaborative Design Studio (DCDS) which allows multimodal real-time remote exchanges, and which aims at re-creating remotely the conditions of co-present meetings. This environment associates a videoconference tool (supporting verbal and non-verbal communication) and an original realtime shared digital hand-drawn sketches system (supporting graphical communication). The users can import documents and annotate them in real-time at distance. In this paper, we are interested in studying the use of the graphical modality (digital sketch and document annotations) as a tool for collective design and remote communication. This study takes place in the framework of a collaborative architectural design studio, which has taken place during 3 month, and gathering students from Belgium and France to work together in 3 small groups mainly at distance. The study focuses on the role of graphical modality in the synchronous remote meetings supported by the DCDS. We identify the types of digital annotations made on the imported document, thanks to the electronic pen, and their role in the cognitive processes of designing and in the collaboration and communication processes. We also identify the different practices of digital sketching, according to the group and its collaborative strategies. We discuss the utility of the graphical modality as an efficient support for collaborative synchronous activities and show that the DCDS environment supports different strategies of collaborative design (co-design and distributed design). We conclude on recommendations for improving the system and for designing sketch-based collaborative environments.</ab>

        <ab>In the areas of design, especially in architectural design, collaboration has become an important challenge. The specialization of skills increase, work teams are more and more extensive and the geographic distance between them increases too. The economic and ecological stakes related to remote collaboration are an evidence. This context involves the need to support most efficiently possible remote working meetings. We present the Distributed Collaborative Digital Studio (DSDC), a tool designed to recreate, in distant situations, the context of copresence meetings. This shared environment is created in the 'invisible computer' approach [11]. The idea is that the tool should disappear from user's consciousness. Indeed, creative design activities require some fluidity in their process. Therefore, any involuntary interruption created by the system can potentially brake creativity. In this perspective, we investigate specifically the 'invisibility' of our environment. To do this, we propose a framework for the operationalization of the concept and a methodology to test the system invisibility. This methodology was applied through a case study consisting of a corpus of 12 hours of remote collaborative design sessions with the DSDC. We highlight the learning effects while using our system, conclude on its effectiveness and discuss our methodology.</ab>

        <ab>During employment of icons in order to represent system functions, specific user requirements from elderly people have not been scientifically gathered and thus will merely be considered during the process of system design. The survey, with explicit consideration of technology acceptance and experience of 120 elderly probands, looked into the comprehension of four different classes of non-animated graphical representations. It was shown that among elderly, the use of photos compared to pictograms or clip art leads to a significantly higher recognition rate. The mapping of actions rather than objects leads to a further reduction of the error probability and is thus, especially in the context of telemedicine, preferable for the target group.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on basic medical licensing systems in the U.S. that pose as obstacles to the use of telemedicine in the country. Most medical regulations require physicians to acquire licenses to provide their services on a state-by-state basis and inhibit the electronic treatment of patients across state lines. According to Jay Sanders, director of the Medical College of Georgia telemedicine center, the existing laws prevent the use of a technology that makes distances transparent. In contrast, other experts have pointed out that telemedicine has created an open and customer-driven marketplace for medical services.</ab>

        <ab>By developing a number of measures distinguishing amount, type of content, and when and how that content is used, the current study revealed effective patterns of use that are associated with quality of life benefits during an eHealth intervention. Results generally suggest that the benefits depend on how a patient uses the system, far more than on sheer amount of exposure or even what type of content is chosen. The next generation of eHealth system should focus on providing new and varying content over time, but even more on encouraging intensity of use and long-term commitment to the system.</ab>

        <ab>The ability to generate and use registries--lists of patients with specific conditions, medications, or test results--is considered a measure of physicians' engagement with electronic health record systems and a proxy for high-quality health care. We conducted a pre-post survey of registry capability among physicians participating in the Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative, a four-year, $50 million health information technology program. Physicians who participated in the program increased their ability to generate some types of registries--specifically, for laboratory results and medication use. Our analysis also suggested that physicians who used their electronic health records more intensively were more likely to use registries, particularly in caring for patients with diabetes, compared to physicians reporting less avid use of electronic health records. This statewide project may be a viable model for regional efforts to expand health information technology and improve the quality of care.</ab>

        <ab>Already crowded and stressful, US emergency departments (EDs) are facing the challenge of serving an aging population that requires complex and lengthy evaluations. Creative solutions are necessary to improve the value and ensure the quality of emergency care delivered to older adults while more fully addressing their complex underlying physical, social, cognitive, and situational needs. Developing models of geriatric emergency care, including some that are already in use at dedicated geriatric EDs, incorporate a variety of physical, procedural, and staffing changes. Among the options for "geriatricizing" emergency care are approaches that may eliminate the need for an ED visit, such as telemedicine; for initial hospitalization, such as patient observation units; and for rehospitalization, such as comprehensive discharge planning. By transforming their current safety-net role to becoming a partner in care coordination, EDs have the opportunity to become better integrated into the broader health care system, improve patient health outcomes, contribute to optimizing the health care system, and reduce overall costs of care-keys to improving emergency care for patients of all ages.</ab>

        <ab>Arguably, few factors will change the future face of the American health care workforce as widely and dramatically as health information technology (IT) and electronic health (e-health) applications. We explore how such applications designed for providers and patients will affect the future demand for physicians. We performed what we believe to be the most comprehensive review of the literature to date, including previously published systematic reviews and relevant individual studies. We estimate that if health IT were fully implemented in 30 percent of community-based physicians' offices, the demand for physicians would be reduced by about 4-9 percent. Delegation of care to nurse practitioners and physician assistants supported by health IT could reduce the future demand for physicians by 4-7 percent. Similarly, IT-supported delegation from specialist physicians to generalists could reduce the demand for specialists by 2-5 percent. The use of health IT could also help address regional shortages of physicians by potentially enabling 12 percent of care to be delivered remotely or asynchronously. These estimated impacts could more than double if comprehensive health IT systems were adopted by 70 percent of US ambulatory care delivery settings. Future predictions of physician supply adequacy should take these likely changes into account.</ab>

        <ab>A Dual Radio ZigBee Homecare Gateway (DRZHG) has been proposed and implemented to support remote patient monitoring. The novelty of DR-ZHG is two-fold. Firstly, it increases the transmission data rate of ZigBee. The Dual Radio ZigBee design furnishes low latency and highly accurate telehealth service at home. Secondly, the zero-configuration design of the DR-ZHG offers the most user friendly telehealth service to elderly people and long-terms patients. Analysis reveals that, for streaming data devices, the network depth should be confined to three (3) in a ZigBee tree network. As for polling data devices, it is analyzed that nine (9) sensors can be supported in a single hop communication. To align with the maximum hop count of three (3) for streaming devices, seven (7) polling devices can be accommodated. In summary, the developed DR-ZHG supports seven (7) polling service sensors and one (1) streaming service senor. Such a gateway meets the general latency standard of 2s for telemedicine services as stipulated by U.S. NIST.</ab>

        <ab>An optimisation technique for newly shaped fractal structure using particle swarm optimisation with curve fitting is presented in this article. The aim of particle swarm optimisation is to find the geometry of the antenna for the required user-defined frequency. To assess the effectiveness of the presented method, a set of representative numerical simulations have been done and the results are compared with the measurements from experimental prototypes built according to the design specifications coming from the optimisation procedure. The proposed fractal antenna resonates at the 5.8 GHz industrial, scientific and medical band which is suitable for wireless telemedicine applications. The antenna characteristics have been studied using extensive numerical simulations and are experimentally verified. The antenna exhibits well-defined radiation patterns over the band.</ab>

        <ab>This study explores how teams create opportunities for learning through medical talk in video conferences (VCs). The empirical context is 47 real-time VCs carried out between general practitioners (GPs) and specialists to examine collaborative work through medical talk. Sixteen of the observations were consultations wherein knowledge was shared with the purpose of solving a specific medical problem. Eight interviews were done face-to-face with a focus on the content of the talk, with the purpose of examining the findings of the observations. Analysis of information and knowledge sharing in medical talk through discussing a patient's medical record shows that collaborative work creates opportunities for learning. The participants describe, inform, recommend, explain and confirm in a two-way process. Individuals' different experience-based knowledge and scientific knowledge closes the knowledge gapsbetween GP and specialist. Contradictions between the individual's thinking and the knowledge collectively shared furthers the activity. Regular VCs offer the opportunity to be part of a distributed team that expands the opportunity provided by irregular phone calls, deviates from the expected course of traditional procedures for doing medical work and creates a space for learning. The VC facilitates collaboration and collective reflection as a distributed health care team.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we discuss a telehealth project aimed at delivering mental health crisis interventions to patients in two rural hospitals in Southern Ontario, Canada, by creating a virtual psychiatric emergency department (ED) using telehealth technology. A participatory action research approach was followed as a design framework for this project. A formal process based on Kouzes and Posner's five practices of exemplary leadership was crafted and closely followed, given the critical role of leadership necessary for the success of this project. The programme achieved its goal and was well received by patients and staff. ED physicians felt supported by the available psychiatric and mental health nursing expertise. Staff satisfaction with the protocols and processes were high, and ED physicians felt confident in the support they received during the decision-making process for appropriate disposition of the patient.</ab>

        <ab>Recognition of petroleum as a finite global resource has spurred increasing interest in the intersection between petroleum scarcity and public health. Local health departments represent a critical yet highly vulnerable component of the public health infrastructure. These frontline agencies currently face daunting resource constraints and rely heavily on petroleum for vital population-based health services. Against this backdrop, petroleum scarcity may necessitate reconfiguring local public health service approaches. We describe the anticipated impacts of petroleum scarcity on local health departments, recommend the use of the 10 Essential Public Health Services as a framework for examining attendant operational challenges and potential responses to them, and describe approaches that local health departments and their stakeholders could consider as part of timely planning efforts.</ab>

        <ab>This section offers news briefs on occupational health as of July 29, 2011. Kim Burton, an occupational health consultant and honorary fellow of the Faculty of Occupational Medicine was awarded an Order of the British Empire (OBE) at the Queens Birthday Honours in June 2011. A study by the Benenden Healthcare Society revealed that women take more sick leaves than men. The British Medical Journal published evidence that employees who are pressured to work while unwell are likely to develop debilitating health conditions.</ab>

        <ab>This article examines the relationship between interpersonal trust and virtual collaborative relationship (VCR) performance. Findings from a study of 10 operational telemedicine projects in health care delivery systems are presented. The results presented here confirm, extend, and apparently contradict prior studies of interpersonal trust. Four types of interpersonal trust--calculative, competence, relational, and integrated--are identified and operationalized as a single construct. We found support for an association between calculative, competence, and relational interpersonal trust and performance. Our finding of a positive association between integrated interpersonal trust and performance not only yields the strongest support for a relationship between trust and VCR performance but also contradicts prior research. Our findings indicate that the different types of trust are interrelated in that positive assessments of all three types of trust are necessary if VCRs are to have strongly positive performance. The study also established that if any one type of trust is negative, then it is very likely that VCR performance will not be positive. Our findings indicate that integrated types of interpersonal trust are interdependent, and the various patterns of interaction among them are such that they are mutually reinforcing. These interrelationships and interdependencies of the different types of interpersonal trust must be taken into account by researchers as they attempt to understand the impact of trust on virtual collaborative relationship performance.</ab>

        <ab>Korean Americans (KAs) have among the highest smoking rates in the United States. They are unlikely to participate in conventional evidence-based smoking cessation programs, preferring to quit on their own. Since KAs have good Internet access, the study's community advisory board recommended evaluating the efficacy of an online cessation program. In conjunction with the board, an Internet-based, self-help program was adapted to ensure that it was culturally and linguistically appropriate and was evaluated with a randomized trial. This article describes the real-world experience recruiting 1,261 KA participants, primarily through online methods. Paid online advertising was essential to the recruitment effort. The 31 months of advertising cost approximately $84,000, or $66.50 per study enrollee. Based on self-reports, most participants learned about the study from either a text link such as Google AdWords (44%) and/or a graphic link such as an online newspaper ad (35%). Among the methods used, Google AdWords' cost-per-click content site ads were the most cost-effective. Other types of outreach, including unpaid Internet ads, cable television, newspapers, fliers, and word of mouth, had very low reach. Geographically dispersed, linguistically unique, and privacy-oriented communities can be recruited for eHealth studies and interventions. However, a paid advertising campaign may be necessary.

        <ab>The recent proliferation of information technology designed to support or enhance an individual professional's task performance has made the investigation of technology acceptance increasingly challenging and significant. This study investigates technology acceptance by individual professionals by examining physicians' decision to accept telemedicine technology. Synthesized from relevant prior research, a generic research framework was built to provide a necessary foundation upon which a research model for telemedicine technology acceptance by physicians could be developed. The research model was then empirically examined, using data collected from more than 400 physicians practicing in public tertiary hospitals in Hong Kong. Results of the study suggest several areas where individual "professionals" might subtly differ in their technology acceptance decision-making, as compared with end users and business managers in ordinary business settings. Specifically, physicians appeared to be fairly pragmatic, largely anchoring their acceptance decisions in the usefulness of the technology rather than its ease of use. When making decisions to accept a technology, physicians expressed considerable concerns about the compatibility of the technology with their practices, placed less importance on controlling technology operations, and attached limited weight to peers' opinions about using the technology. Based on results obtained from this study, the initially proposed framework for technology acceptance by individual professionals was revised to a "hierarchical, three-layer" structure with the individual context at the inner core, the implementation context on the outermost layer, and the technological context residing in the middle. Implications for information systems research and telemedicine management practice that have emerged from the study's findings are also discussed.</ab>

        <ab>The rapid growth of investment in information technology (IT) by organizations worldwide has made user acceptance an increasingly critical technology implementation and management issue. While such acceptance has received fairly extensive attention from previous research, additional efforts are needed to examine or validate existing research results, particularly those involving different technologies, user populations, and/or organizational contexts. In response, this paper reports a research work that examined the applicability of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in explaining physicians' decisions to accept telemedicine technology in the health-care context. The technology, the user group, and the organizational context are all new to IT acceptance/adoption research. The study also addressed a pragmatic technology management need resulting from millions of dollars invested by healthcare organizations in developing and implementing telemedicine programs in recent years. The model's overall fit, explanatory power, and the individual causal links that it postulates were evaluated by examining the acceptance of telemedicine technology among physicians practicing at public tertiary hospitals in Hong Kong. The authors' results suggested that TAM was able to provide a reasonable depiction of physicians' intention to use telemedicine technology. Perceived usefulness was found to be a significant determinant of attitude and intention but perceived ease of use was not. The relatively low R-square of the model suggests both the limitations of the parsimonious model and the need for incorporating additional factors or integrating with other IT acceptance models in order to improve its specificity and explanatory utility in a health-care context. Based on the study findings, implications for user technology acceptance research and telemedicine management are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>The role of primary care nurses has expanded in recent years, and many now work for urgent care service providers. With role expansion comes increased professional autonomy, but this, in turn, carries a greater risk of error and, consequently, a greater need for medicolegal protection. This article considers some of the risks associated with out-of-hours care delivery, particularly in relation to telephone triage.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to measure the ability of telemonitoring to reduce hospital days and total costs for Medicare managed care enrollees diagnosed with heart failure. Patients were recruited and randomly assigned for six months to either telemonitoring or standard care. Telemonitoring transmitted vital signs and clinical alerts daily to a central nursing station. Utilization of covered services was analyzed for the six-month telemonitoring period to test for hypothesized reductions in hospital days and changes in utilization of the emergency department (ED), urgent care, and primary care. Negative binomial regressions adjusted for gender, age, co-occurring diabetes, co-occurring chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and residence neighborhood were used to analyze units of service, and two-part (hurdle) multivariable models were used for expenditures. The main finding was a tendency for lower total number of hospital days for patients assigned to telemonitoring. Results for other covered services were generally consistent with hypothesized direction and magnitude; however, statistical power was reduced because of lower- than-expected recruitment rates into the study. Within a managed-care environment, telemonitoring appears to facilitate better ambulatory management of heart failure patients, including fewer ED visits, which were offset by more frequent primary care and urgent care visits.</ab>

        <ab>Objective. To identify the coverage of a diabetic retinopathy screening program in primary health care and to assess agreement between ophthalmologists and family physicians (FP) regarding retinography evaluations of diabetic patients. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional observational study, with a review of diabetic patients' mydriatic retinographies (2007-2008) from three urban primary health centers (PHC)(Jaén-Spain). Results. A total of 296 retinographies in 2007 and 380 in 2008 (coverage=26%±2,4) were reviewed. Pathological retinographies were identified by 181 FPs (27%±1,3) and 59 (9%±0,3) ophthalmologists. Total agreement was moderate (kappa=0,408±0,039). Agreement was better in the latter year (0,45 vs 0,34;p&lt;0,001 testΞ²). FP evaluations showed 97% sensitivity, 80% speciicity, 33% positive predictive value, 100% negative predictive value, 4,88 positive likelihood ratio and 0,04 negative likelihood ratio. We ind variability in coverage and agreement between PHC. Conclusions. Mydriatic retinographies performed and evaluated by FPs are useful to retinopathy screening of diabetic patients. Coverage, predictive values and likelihood ratio were better in the latter year, although the interpretation should be homogenized.</ab>

        <ab>Knowledge is central to the modern economy and society. Indeed, the knowledge society has transformed the concept of knowledge and is more and more aware of the need to overcome the lack of knowledge when has to make options or address its problems and dilemmas. One’s knowledge is less based on exact facts and more on hypotheses, perceptions or indications. Even when we use new computational artefacts and novel methodologies for problem solving, like the use of Group Decision Support Systems (GDSSs), the question of incomplete information is in most of the situations marginalized. On the other hand, common sense tells us that when a decision is made it is impossible to have a perception of all the information involved and the nature of its intrinsic quality. Therefore, something has to be made in terms of the information available and the process of its evaluation. It is under this framework that a Multi-valued Extended Logic Programming language will be used for knowledge representation and reasoning, leading to a model that embodies the Quality-of-Information (QoI) and its quantification, along the several stages of the decision-making process. In this way, it is possible to provide a measure of the value of the QoI that supports the decision itself. This model will be here presented in the context of a GDSS for VirtualECare, a system aimed at sustaining online healthcare services.</ab>

        <ab>Many factors combine to drive the growth in health spending worldwide, but the introduction of new technologies, drugs, and therapies is probably the most important. However, in contrast to other industries, innovations in health care have not tended to reduce the need for labor. In fact, labor still accounts for the largest proportion of expenditures in many health systems. But labor-saving technologies, workforce innovations, and patient self-care approaches are now emerging and altering health care's labor structure. For example, in Mexico more than one million households pay $5 per month to access a health advice hotline before setting foot in a physician's office. In India assembly line-style eye surgery has dramatically reduced cost without sacrificing quality. Policy makers should focus on such labor-saving innovations; reform reimbursement systems to encourage them; tackle professionals' resistance; and remove regulatory barriers. Bold experiments to redesign health services around patient self-care approaches are also warranted.</ab>

        <ab>Use of e-health, or electronic information technologies, has spread to cities and remote villages worldwide. Countries such as Rwanda are activating nationwide e-health networks. The Rockefeller Foundation's month-long 2008 conference Making the eHealth Connection: Global Partners, Local Solutions accelerated this process. Conference participants proposed global partnerships, health technology solutions based on local needs, cross-border interoperability, leveraging current open-source networks, and shared informatics systems; they achieved progress on a shared, cross-border understanding of e-health solutions and policy. Early steps toward furthering these goals include creation of a new organization, the mHealth Alliance, to coordinate efforts, but collaborative investments are needed to usher in the promise of e-health.</ab>

        <ab>An interview with SwiftMD chief executive officer (CEO) Doctor Elliot Justin is presented. Justin suggests that the American healthcare industry should change its existing delivery system to increase health access, increase health quality or decrease health costs. He finds telemedicine fun since it is new and that it is cool to be out and work in the emergency room (ER). He notes that SwiftMD sells business-to-business as a benefit making its sale cycle long.</ab>

        <ab>The authors assessed age-group differences in the use, satisfaction and perceptions of 3 acute-care options: after-hours clinics (AHCs), telecare, and hospital emergency departments (EDs). In all, 165 self-administered community surveys were returned. Younger adults used AHCs and telecare more often than did other age groups. Middle-aged and older adults did not differ on ED use, and age groups did not differ on satisfaction. The 3 age groups had similar views of when it was appropriate to use AHCs and when to use telecare. Generally, respondents felt that AHCs and telecare were less appropriate for serious health problems and when needing medical tests. The authors also found that information concerning what services AHCs offer was difficult to access.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses ideas that have received little attention in the debate to reform the U.S. health care system. Under a value-based payment system patients would pay a higher fraction of the cost for elective treatment than for necessary care. Evidence-based medicine wold reimburse only for those treatments with documented efficacy. The concept of a "medical home" involves a single physician coordinating the totality of a patient's care. "Telemedicine" would make greater use of telecommunications technology in the provision of care.</ab>

        <ab>An interview with Dr. James Madara, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the American Medical Association, is presented. When asked about medicine not being a career choice recommended by physicians, Madara states that healthcare need an improvement. Madara focuses on the dissimilarity in ICD-10 diagnostic coding system in the U.S. and in other countries and discusses the impact of data about individual physicians' Medicare payments, released by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on telemedicine, which aims to improve patient care and lower the cost of health care facilities. It discusses various forms in which telehealth facilities are available including midnight intensive-care unit consultations, remote readings of radiologic images and telephone outreach services for individuals with chronic health conditions. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee has decided to pay reimbursement to Telehealth firms at the same rate as Medicare providers.</ab>

        <ab>Nowadays, chronic heart failure (CHF) affects an ever-growing segment of population, and it is among the major causes of hospitalization for elderly citizens. The actual out-of-hospital treatment model, based on periodic visits, has a low capability to detect signs of destabilization and leads to a high re-hospitalization rate. To this aim, in this paper, a complete and integrated Information and Communication Technology system is described enabling the CHF patients to daily collect vital signs at home and automatically send them to the Hospital Information System, allowing the physicians to monitor their patients at distance and take timely actions in case of necessity. A minimum set of vital parameters has been identified, consisting of electrocardiogram, SpO2, blood pressure, and weight, measured through a pool of wireless, non-invasive biomedical sensors. A multi-channel front-end IC for cardiac sensor interfacing has been also developed. Sensor data acquisition and signal processing are in charge of an additional device, the home gateway. All signals are processed upon acquisition in order to assert if both punctual values and extracted trends lay in a safety zone established by thresholds. Per-patient personalized thresholds, required measurements and transmission policy are allowed. As proved by first medical tests, the proposed telemedicine platform represents a valid support to early detect the alterations in vital signs that precede the acute syndromes, allowing early home interventions thus reducing the number of subsequent hospitalizations.</ab>

        <ab>Health-related information collected in psychological laboratories may not be representative of people's everyday health. For at least 70 years, there has been a call for methods that sample experiences from everyday environments and circumstances. New technologies, including cell phones, sensors, and monitors, now make it possible to collect information outside of the laboratory in environments representative of everyday life. We review the role of mobile technologies in the assessment of health-related behaviors, physiological responses, and self-reports. Ecological momentary assessment offers a wide range of new opportunities for ambulatory assessment and evaluation. The value of mobile technologies for interventions to improve health is less well established. Among 21 randomized clinical trials evaluating interventions that used mobile technologies, more than half failed to document significant improvements on health outcomes or health risk factors. Theoretical and practical issues for future research are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Patient-centered care is considered one pillar of a high-performing, high-quality health care system. It is a key component of many efforts to transform care and achieve better population health. Expansion of health information technology and consumer c-health tools—electronic tools and services such as secure e-mail messaging between patients and providers, or mobile health apps—have created new opportunities for individuals to participate actively in monitoring and directing their health and health care. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in the Department of Health and Human Services leads the strategy to increase electronic access to health information, support the development of tools that enable people to take action with that information, and shift attitudes related to the traditional roles of patients and providers. In this article we review recent evidence in support of consumer c-health and present the federal strategy to promote advances in consumer c-health to increase patient engagement, improve individual health, and achieve broader health care system improvements.</ab>

        <ab>Patient-centeredness—the idea that care should be designed around patients' needs, preferences, circumstances, and well-being—is a central tenet of health care delivery. For CEOs of health care organizations, patient-centered care is also quickly becoming a business imperative, with payments tied to performance on measures of patient satisfaction and engagement. In A CEO Checklist for High-Value Health Care, we, as executives of eleven leading health care delivery institutions, outlined ten key strategies for reducing costs and waste while improving outcomes. In this article we describe how implementation of these strategies benefits both health care organizations and patients. For example, Kaiser Permanente's Healthy Bones Program resulted in a 30 percent reduction in hip fracture rates for at-risk patients. And at Virginia Mason Health System in Seattle, nurses reorganized care patterns and increased the time they spent on direct patient care to 90 percent. Our experiences show that patient-engaged care can be delivered in ways that simultaneously improve quality and reduce costs.</ab>

        <ab>Shared decision making is an approach to care that seeks to fully inform patients about the risks and benefits of available treatments and engage them as participants in decisions about the treatments. Although recent federal and state policies pursue the expanded use of shared decision making as a way to improve care quality and patient experience, payers and providers want evidence that this emerging model of care is cost-effective. We examined data obtained from a yearlong randomized investigation. The study compared the effects on patients of receiving a usual level of support in making a medical treatment decision with the effects of receiving enhanced support, which included more contact with trained health coaches through telephone, mail, e-mail, and the Internet. We found that patients who received enhanced support had 5.3 percent lower overall medical costs than patients who received the usual level of support. The enhanced-support group had 12.5 percent fewer hospital admissions than the usual-support group, and 9.9 percent fewer preference-sensitive surgeries, including 20.9 percent fewer preference-sensitive heart surgeries. These findings indicate that support for shared decision making can generate savings. They also suggest that a "remote" model of support—combining telephonic coaching with decision aids, for example—may constitute a relatively low-cost and effective intervention that could reach broader populations without the need for the direct involvement of regular medical care team members.</ab>

        <ab>Behavior consultants conducted functional analyses (FAs) via telehealth with 20 young children with autism spectrum disorders between the ages of 29 and 80 months who displayed problem behavior and lived an average of 222 miles from the tertiary hospital that housed the behavior consultants. Participants' parents conducted all procedures during weekly telehealth consultations in regional clinics located an average of 15 miles from the participants' homes. Behavior consultants briefly trained parent assistants to provide on-site support for families during consultations. FAs completed within a multielement design identified environmental variables that maintained problem behavior for 18 of the 20 cases, and interrater agreement averaged over 90%. Results suggested that behavior analysts can conduct FAs effectively and efficiently via telehealth.</ab>

        <ab>This paper presents a 3-D medical image coding method featuring two major improvements to previous work on 3-D region of interest (RoI) coding for telemedicine applications. Namely, 1) a data prioritization scheme that allows coding of multiple 3-D-RoIs; and 2) a joint/source channel coding scheme that allows prioritized transmission of multiple 3-D-RoIs over wireless channels. The method, which is based on the 3-D integer wavelet transform and embedded block coding with optimized truncation with 3-D context modeling, generates scalable and error-resilient bit streams with 3-D-RoI decoding capabilities. Coding of multiple 3-D-RoIs is attained by prioritizing the wavelet-transformed data according to a Gaussian mixed distribution, whereas error resiliency is attained by employing the error correction capabilities of rate-compatible punctured turbo codes. The robustness of the proposed method is evaluated for transmission of real 3-D medical images over Rayleigh-fading channels with a priori knowledge of the channel condition. Evaluation results show that the proposed coding method provides a superior performance compared to equal error protection and unequal error protection techniques.</ab>

        <ab>Fetal ECG (FECG) telemonitoring is an important branch in telemedicine. The design of a telemonitoring system via a wireless body area network with low energy consumption for ambulatory use is highly desirable. As an emerging technique, compressed sensing (CS) shows great promise in compressing/reconstructing data with low energy consumption. However, due to some specific characteristics of raw FECG recordings such as nonsparsity and strong noise contamination, current CS algorithms generally fail in this application. This paper proposes to use the block sparse Bayesian learning framework to compress/reconstruct nonsparse raw FECG recordings. Experimental results show that the framework can reconstruct the raw recordings with high quality. Especially, the reconstruction does not destroy the interdependence relation among the multichannel recordings. This ensures that the independent component analysis decomposition of the reconstructed recordings has high fidelity. Furthermore, the framework allows the use of a sparse binary sensing matrix with much fewer nonzero entries to compress recordings. Particularly, each column of the matrix can contain only two nonzero entries. This shows that the framework, compared to other algorithms such as current CS algorithms and wavelet algorithms, can greatly reduce code execution in CPU in the data compression stage.</ab>

        <ab>We present a flexible, compact antenna system intended for telemedicine applications. The design is based on an M-shaped printed monopole antenna operating in the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) 2.45 GHz band integrated with a miniaturized slotted Jerusalem Cross (JC) Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) ground plane. The AMC ground plane is utilized to isolate the user's body from undesired electromagnetic radiation in addition to minimizing the antenna's impedance mismatch caused by the proximity to human tissues. Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is analyzed using a numerical human body model (HUGO) to assess the feasibility of the proposed design. The antenna expresses 18% impedance bandwidth; moreover, the inclusion of the AMC ground plane increases the front to back ratio by 8 dB, provides 3.7 dB increase in gain, in addition to 64% reduction in SAR. Experimental and numerical results show that the radiation characteristics, impedance matching, and SAR values of the proposed design are significantly improved compared to conventional monopole and dipole antennas. Furthermore, it offers a compact and flexible solution which makes it a good candidate for the wearable telemedicine application.</ab>

        <ab>Network infrastructure tools have evolved into keen-eyed monitoring and management systems that can help IT managers answer tough questions about network readiness and performance. eWeek Labs reviewed the latest versions of three venerable monitoring systems to see how their core features can help predict networks' ability to support new applications. eWeek Labs evaluated the latest editions of three tried and true network management tools to get a better understanding of how they can help IT managers assess the readiness of networks to accommodate these new applications, in addition to tracking daily operations. eWeek reviewed BMC Software Inc.'s Patrol Visualis 1.4, Concord Communications Inc.'s eHealth Suite 5.6 and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s OpenView Network Node Manager Advanced Edition 7.01. Tests showed that none of the products has changed significantly in the last several years, although all of them, through add-ons and new product modules, have been kept upto-date.

        <ab>The article reports that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has changed rules to make more rural areas eligible for its subsidy program and to increase discounts for mobile satellite services. At its December 15, 2004 meeting, the FCC adopted an order and further notice of proposed rulemaking to expand the reach of the rural health care portion of the Universal Service Fund, which is authorized to provide as much as $400 million in telemedicine funding annually. The Commission said the move would better target small towns and villages while maintaining a focus on the neediest areas.</ab>

        <ab>Given the risk and cost of proposed but unproven technologies, a method to project likely outcomes offers great value. Visioning studies deliver that opportunity by enabling potential users and other stakeholders the chance to explore new technologies. Goals include validating benefits, exposing unanticipated consequences, discovering hurdles to deployment and revealing considerations for funding. A visioning study was used to investigate 3D telepresence technology in emergency health care, enabling paramedics to work on a simulated trauma victim along with a remote physician. In another phase of the study, three groups of stakeholders viewed a brief video on the proposed technology and were interviewed to understand their thoughts on advantages, obstacles and potential fit. Through the visioning study, researchers were able to explore implementation of the technology and experience its potential benefits and challenges in a realistic test mode. Knowledge gained through visioning can lead to better-informed decisions and more effective use of limited resources.</ab>

        <ab>The Coordinated-Transitional Care (C-TraC) Program was designed to improve care coordination and outcomes among veterans with high-risk conditions discharged to community settings from the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital, in Madison, Wisconsin. Under the program, patients work with nurse case managers on care and health issues, including medication reconciliation, before and after hospital discharge, with all contacts made by phone once the patient is at home. Patients who received the C-TraC protocol experienced one-third fewer rehospitalizations than those in a baseline comparison group, producing an estimated savings of $1,225 per patient net of programmatic costs. This model requires a relatively small amount of resources to operate and may represent a viable alternative for hospitals seeking to offer improved transitional care as encouraged by the Affordable Care Act. In particular, the model may be attractive for providers in rural areas or other care settings challenged by wide geographic dispersion of patients or by constrained resources.</ab>

        <ab>A wireless portable monitoring system for respiratory diseases using microsensors is proposed. The monitoring system consists of two sensor nodes integrating with Bluetooth transmitters that measure user's respiratory airflow, blood oxygen saturation, and body posture. The utility of micro-hot-film flow sensor makes the monitor can acquire comprehensive respiration parameters which are useful for diagnoses of obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. The system can serve as both sleep recorder and spirometer. Additionally, a mobile phone or a PC connected to the Internet serving as a monitoring and transfer terminal makes telemedicine achievable. Several experiments were conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system for monitoring and diagnosing OSA, COPD, and asthma.</ab>

        <ab>Health information exchange (HIE) offers tremendous potential for the future, but its widespread adoption and sustainability depend upon engaging patients and earning their trust. Patients' willingness to allow their data to be shared will drive the usefulness of HIE and therefore the sustainability of regional health information organizations (RHIOs). The Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative (MAeHC) is one of a few organizations that have developed a successful community-based collaborative model, with more than a 90 percent opt-in rate among patients to participate in widespread electronic data sharing. Lessons learned from MAeHC's three pilot programs could be instructive for other HIE projects around the country.</ab>

        <ab>The Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative and the New York City Primary Care Information Project have provided financial subsidies and extensive support to help hundreds of independent medical practices successfully adopt electronic health records. Their efforts address overcoming key barriers such as the amount of start-up funds needed, productivity lost during implementation, and the difficulty of choosing the right system. Their approaches differ: the Massachusetts project emphasizes continuity of care within selected communities; New York emphasizes improvements in preventive care and chronic disease management across a population. Both, however, offer valuable insights that can be applied elsewhere.</ab>

        <ab>The Affordable Care Act is funding the expansion of community health centers to increase access to primary care, but this approach will not ensure effective access to subspecialty services. To address this issue, we interviewed directors of twenty community health centers. Our analysis of their responses led us to identify six unique models of how community health centers access subspecialty care, which we called Tin Cup, Hospital Partnership, Buy Your Own Subspecialists, Telehealth, Teaching Community, and Integrated System. We determined that the Integrated System model appears to provide the most comprehensive and cohesive access to subspecialty care. Because Medicaid accountable care organizations encourage integrated delivery of care, they offer a promising policy solution to improve the integration of community health centers into "medical neighborhoods."</ab>

        <ab>Many classes of images contains spatial regions which are more important than other regions. Compression methods which are capable of delivering higher reconstruction quality are attractive in this situation for the important parts. For the medical images, only a small portion of the image might be diagnostically useful, but the cost of a wrong interpretation is high. Hence, Region Based Coding (RBC) technique is significant for medical image compression and transmission. Lossless compression in these 'regions' and lossy compression for rest of image can helps to achieve high efficiency and performance in telemedicine applications. This paper proposes an automated, efficient and low complexity, lossless, scalable RBC for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images. The advantages of RBC are exploited in this paper, segmenting the region into various regions of importance and subjecting varying bit-rates for optimal performance. Moreover, the combined effects of Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) and bit-rate limiting compression technique for lesser important regions helps reconstruct the image, reversibly, up to a desired quality. The overall compression thus reaches a satisfactory level to be able to safely transmit the image in limited bandwidth over a telemedicine network and reconstruct diagnostic details for treatment, most faithfully.</ab>

        <ab>It costs about $1.2 billion to bring a single new drug to market in the U.S. today. With a combination of high latestage failure rates and the high cost of drug trials, the number of new drugs being approved by the FDA has flatlined at historically low levels, falling from 53 in 1996 to just 19 in 2009. If the cost of drug trials doesn't come down, we will see far fewer new drugs on pharmacy shelves.</ab>

        <ab>To compare the benefits of the Internet generally versus a focused system of services, 257 breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to a control group, access to the Internet with links to high-quality breast cancer sites, or access to an eHealth system (Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System, CHESS) that integrated information, support, and decision and analysis tools. The intervention lasted 5 months, and self-report data on quality of life, health-care competence, and social support were collected at pretest and at 2-, 4-, and 9-month posttests. CHESS subjects logged on more overall than Internet subjects and accessed more health resources, but the latter used non health-related sites more. Subjects with access to the Internet alone experienced no better outcomes than controls at any of the 3 time points, compared to pretest levels. Subjects with CHESS experienced greater social support during the intervention period and had higher scores on all 3 outcomes at 9 months, 4 months after the intervention ended. CHESS subjects also scored higher than those with Internet access during the intervention period but not significantly after the intervention ended. Thus, CHESS (with one simple interface and integrated information, communication, and skills services) helped newly diagnosed breast cancer patients even after computers were removed. In contrast, patients received little benefit from Internet access, despite having links to a variety of high-quality sites.</ab>

        <ab>Alaska is an expansive and complex geographic area with many rural communities of small villages and few towns in remote locations. In addition, inadequate healthcare facilities in these locations makes health care management a challenging task in the state of Alaska. Therefore, it is important to find an effective alternative, such as telemedicine, for delivering health care in remote regions of rural Alaska. The objective of this paper is to create a baseline result from the pre-telemedicine data that is important in measuring telemedicine effectiveness after its implementation. In this paper, we focus on data gathered before implementation of the telemedicine to identify factors significant to patients' satisfaction. Four different regions: Maniilaq, Norton Sound, Yukon Kuskokwim, and Bristol Bay Area are selected for the implementation of telemedicine. Regression analysis is used for identifying factors that are important to patients' satisfaction. Regression models are estimated separately for each region, and a separate model is used for all regions combined. The most important factor revealed from the analysis in terms of magnitude and statistical significance is "the perceived level of prescribed treatment" across all regions. The "amount of time that health care provider spent with the patient" is also emerged as an important factor. Another important factor is the "ability to communicate". All these factors are found statistically significant regardless of the geographic region considered in this paper. Therefore, these important factors may be used for the post-telemedicine effectiveness measure.</ab>

        <ab>This article develops an empirical measure of public entrepreneurship and uses it to discover the correlates that distinguish between those participants in a policy domain who are seen as more or less important in the entrepreneurial process. Looking at two rural regions dealing with telemedicine technologies, the authors examine the role of personal attributes and situational attributes in predicting who will emerge as the most mentioned public entrepreneurs on these issues in their community. Status in the local community, membership in the health professions, and strong local focus and ties are the most instrumental variables in distinguishing between those in a policy domain who are more likely to be identified as entrepreneurial. The authors provide an empirical test that can, for the first time, identify in a comparative context the traits that distinguish more entrepreneurial individuals from less entrepreneurial ones (or nonentrepreneurial ones) participating in the same policy domain.</ab>

        <ab>Machine-to-machine communication, a promising technology for the smart city concept, enables ubiquitous connectivity between one or more autonomous devices without or with minimal human interaction. M2M communication is the key technology to support data transfer among sensors and actuators to facilitate various smart city applications (e.g., smart metering, surveillance and security, infrastructure management, city automation, and eHealth). To support massive numbers of machine type communication (MTC) devices, one of the challenging issues is to provide an efficient way for multiple access in the network and to minimize network overload. In this article, we review the M2M communication techniques in Long Term Evolution- Advanced cellular networks and outline the major research issues. Also, we review the different random access overload control mechanisms to avoid congestion caused by random channel access of MTC devices. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning-based eNB selection algorithm that allows the MTC devices to choose the eNBs (or base stations) to transmit packets in a self-organizing fashion.</ab>

        <ab>A sufficient cardiology workforce is necessary to ensure access to cardiovascular care. Specifically, access to cardiologists is important in the management and treatment of chronic cardiovascular disease. Given this, we examined the supply and distribution of the cardiologist workforce. In doing so, we mapped the ratios of cardiologists, primary care physicians, and total physicians to the population age sixty-five or older within different Hospital Referral Regions from the years 1995 and 2007. We found that within the twelve-year span of our study, the cardiology workforce grew modestly compared with the primary care physician and total physician workforces. Also, despite increases in the number of cardiologists, there was a persistent geographic maldistribution of the workforce. For example, approximately 60 percent of the elderly population had access to only 38 percent of the cardiologists. Our results suggest that large segments of the US population, specifically in rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, continue to have a lower concentration of cardiologists. This maldistribution could be addressed through a variety of strategies, including the use of telemedicine and economic incentives.</ab>

        <ab>The Indian Health Service (IHS), a federal health system, cares for 2 million of the country's 5.2 million American Indian and Alaska Native people. This system has increasingly focused on innovative uses of health information technology and telemedicine, as well as comprehensive, locally tailored prevention and disease management programs, to promote health equity in a population facing multiple health disparities. Important recent achievements include a reduction in the life-expectancy gap between American Indian and Alaska Native people and whites (from eight years to five years) and improved measures of diabetes control (including 20 percent and 10 percent reductions in the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c, respectively). However, disparities persist between American Indian and Alaska Native people and the overall US population. Continued innovation and increased funding are required to further improve health and achieve equity.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports on the use of audio-video capabilities to perform remote monitoring to a patient presented with stroke-like symptoms. It mentions that stroke neurologists are able to access patents remotely within the Resurrection Health Care (RHC) and external locations such as in the clinic, office, and home. It suggests the need for healthcare leaders to appreciate and acknowledge the complexity surrounding electronic health record (EHR) design, implementation, and utilization. It argues that patient safety and quality must be at the forefront of every effort to advance care.</ab>

        <ab>Recent technological advances and the heightened expectations of e-health consumers are about to transform the U.S. health care industry. As consumers demand more online services, physicians respond by adopting information technology into their daily routines. In this paper, we first present recent developments within the telemedicine and e-health fields that necessitate the establishment of a consumer-to-healthcare provider (C2H) electronic marketplace. Next, we discuss the services this marketplace should offer to both consumers and physicians for it to thrive in this extensively regulated industry. Finally, we compare these services with those provided by what we call a "first-generation C2H marketplace," a comparison that clearly outlines practical implications for the C2H marketplaces of the future.</ab>

        <ab>Treatment of chronically ill people constitutes nearly four-fifths of US health care spending, but it is hampered by a fragmented delivery system and discontinuities of care. We examined the impact of a care coordination approach called the Health Buddy Program, which integrates a telehealth tool with care management for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. We evaluated the program's impact on spending for patients of two clinics in the US Northwest who were exposed to the intervention, and we compared their experience with that of matched controls. We found significant savings among patients who used the Health Buddy telehealth program, which was associated with spending reductions of approximately 7.7-13.3 percent ($312-$542) per person per quarter. These results suggest that carefully designed and implemented care management and telehealth programs can help reduce health care spending and that such programs merit continued attention by Medicare. Meanwhile, mortality differences in the treatment and control groups suggest that the intervention may have produced noticeable changes in health outcomes, but we leave it to future research to explore these effects fully.</ab>

        <ab>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective in reducing motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, objective methods for quantifying its efficacy are lacking. We present a principal component (PC)-based tracking method for quantifying the effects of DBS in PD by using electromyography (EMG) and acceleration measurements. Ten parameters capturing PD characteristic signal features were initially extracted from isometric EMG and acceleration recordings. Using a PC approach, the original parameters were transformed into a smaller number of PCs. Finally, the effects of DBS were quantified by examining the PCs in a low-dimensional feature space. The EMG and acceleration data from 13 PD patients with DBS ON and OFF, and 13 healthy age-matched controls were used for analysis. Clinical evaluation of patients showed that their motor symptoms were effectively reduced with DBS. The analysis results showed that the signal characteristics of 12 patients were more similar to those of the healthy controls with DBS ON than with DBS OFF. These observations indicate that the PC-based tracking method can be used to objectively quantify the effects of DBS on the neuromuscular function of PD patients. Further studies are suggested to estimate the clinical sensitivity of the method to different types of PD.</ab>

        <ab>Most automatic spike detection systems in the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) focused on the characteristics of “spike.” However, the characteristics of “false positives” (FPs) have not been fully studied. In this paper, we proposed a system that contains a series of algorithms to eliminate FPs and a template method to confirm spikes. The system used large area context available on 49 channels from two common montages. The impact of slow-waves after spikes was taken into consideration, as well as the information from single channel, multichannel, and whole recording. Two types of FPs were identified in this paper. The ones from typical artifacts were identified by analysis of background EEG activities, and the ones from other EEG activities were declared by spatial and temporal characteristics of spike activities. Finally, a multichannel template method was used to assess the performance of the proposed system. The system was evaluated using 17 routine EEG recordings. Spike activities were observed in six of them. Effective multichannel templates were extracted from four recordings containing frequent spikes. The least selectivity was 92.6% and the most false positive rate was 0.26 min ^-1. Proposed algorithms for elimination of FPs are also suitable for other algorithms to enhance performance since most FPs can be identified while few true spikes are eliminated.</ab>

        <ab>This paper introduces a real-time data compression and transmission algorithm between e-health terminals for a periodic ECGsignal. The proposed algorithm consists of five compression procedures and four reconstruction procedures. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the algorithm was applied to all 48 recordings of MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, and the compress ratio (CR), percent root mean square difference (PRD), percent root mean square difference normalized (PRDN), rms, SNR, and quality score (QS) values were obtained. The result showed that the CR was 27.9:1 and the PRD was 2.93 on average for all 48 data instances with a 15% window size. In addition, the performance of the algorithm was compared to those of similar algorithms introduced recently by others. It was found that the proposed algorithm showed clearly superior performance in all 48 data instances at a compression ratio lower than 15:1, whereas it showed similar or slightly inferior PRD performance for a data compression ratio higher than 20:1. In light of the fact that the similarity with the original data becomes meaningless when the PRD is higher than 2, the proposed algorithm shows significantly better performance compared to the performance levels of other algorithms. Moreover, because the algorithm can compress and transmit data in real time, it can be served as an optimal biosignal data transmission method for limited bandwidth communication between e-health devices.</ab>

        <ab>Wireless body sensor networks (WBSN) hold the promise to be a key enabling information and communications technology for next-generation patient-centric telecardiology or mobile cardiology solutions. Through enabling continuous remote cardiac monitoring, they have the potential to achieve improved personalization and quality of care, increased ability of prevention and early diagnosis, and enhanced patient autonomy, mobility, and safety. However, state-of-the-art WBSN-enabled ECG monitors still fall short of the required functionality, miniaturization, and energy efficiency. Among others, energy efficiency can be improved through embedded ECG compression, in order to reduce airtime over energy-hungry wireless links. In this paper, we quantify the potential of the emerging compressed sensing (CS) signal acquisition/compression paradigm for low-complexity energy-efficient ECG compression on the state-of-the-art Shimmer WBSN mote. Interestingly, our results show that CS represents a competitive alternative to state-of-the-art digital wavelet transform (DWT)-based ECG compression solutions in the context of WBSN-based ECG monitoring systems. More specifically, while expectedly exhibiting inferior compression performance than its DWT-based counterpart for a given reconstructed signal quality, its substantially lower complexity and CPU execution time enables it to ultimately outperform DWT-based ECG compression in terms of overall energy efficiency. CS-based ECG compression is accordingly shown to achieve a 37.1\% extension in node lifetime relative to its DWT-based counterpart for “good” reconstruction quality.</ab>

        <ab>The MidSouth eHealth Alliance is developing a comprehensive health information infrastructure supporting providers in three Tennessee counties. Success in the alliance's first year is the result of sustained leadership, a systematic assessment of regional needs and capabilities, a flexible technical architecture, and a critical review of best practices from four different data exchange models already operating in other states. Long-term evolution to a truly interoperable health information infrastructure will depend on the extent to which the alliance demonstrates value to consumers and practitioners.</ab>

Most rural hospitals are considering a health information exchange or a medical home to address the issue. Other hospitals are looking at the use of value-based purchasing by Medicare and the planned expansion of coverage that would increase Medicaid programs, which is a large payer in rural areas.</ab>

Peter Waegemann of mHealth Initiative believes that smartphones will help boost physician adoption of mobile health technology. Particular focus is given to the saturated U.S. mobile-phone market, as well as the estimated value of the mobile health technology market. There are three distinct business cases for mobile-health applications, PwC analysts claim. The American Medical Association launched a smartphone application for physicians in March 2011.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Telerehabilitation may be a feasible solution to the current problems faced by people with Parkinson's disease in accessing speech pathology services. Aim: To investigate the validity and reliability of online delivery of the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT®) for the speech and voice disorder associated with Parkinson's disease. Method &amp; Procedures: Thirty-four participants with Parkinson's disease and mild-to-moderate hypokinetic dysarthria took part in the randomized controlled non-inferiority laboratory trial and received the LSVT® in either the online or the face-to-face environment. Online sessions were conducted via two personal computer-based videoconferencing systems with real-time and store-and-forward capabilities operating on a 128 kbit/s Internet connection. Participants were assessed pre- and post-treatment on acoustic measures of mean vocal sound pressure level, phonation time, maximum fundamental frequency range, and perceptual measures of voice, articulatory precision and speech intelligibility. Outcomes &amp; Results: Non-inferiority of the online LSVT® modality was confirmed for the primary outcome measure of mean change in sound pressure level on a monologue task. Additionally, non-significant main effects for the LSVT® environment, dysarthria severity, and interaction effects were obtained for all outcomes measures. Significant improvements following the LSVT® were also noted on the majority of measures. The LSVT® was successfully delivered online, although some networking difficulties were encountered on a few occasions. High participant satisfaction was reported overall. Conclusions &amp; Implications: Online treatment for hypokinetic dysarthria associated with Parkinson's disease appears to be clinically valid and reliable. Suggestions for future research are outlined.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Patients with Parkinson's disease face numerous access barriers to speech pathology services for appropriate assessment and treatment. Telerehabilitation is a possible solution to this problem, whereby rehabilitation services may be delivered to the patient at a distance, via telecommunication and information technologies. A number of studies have demonstrated the capacity of telerehabilitation to provide reliable and valid assessments of speech, voice and language. However, no studies have specifically focused on assessing patients with Parkinson's disease. Aims: To investigate the validity and reliability of a telerehabilitation application for assessing the speech and voice disorder associated with Parkinson's disease. Methods &amp; Procedures: Sixty-one participants with Parkinson's disease and hypokinetic dysarthria were simultaneously assessed in an online and face-to-face environment by two speech-language pathologists. The assessment protocol included perceptual measures of voice and oromotor function, articulatory precision, speech intelligibility, and acoustic measures of vocal sound pressure level, phonation time and pitch range. Online assessments were conducted via a personal computer-based videoconferencing system with store-and-forward capabilities, operating on a 128 kbit/s Internet connection. The level of agreement between the online and face-to-face ratings was determined using several different analyses, depending on the parameter. These included per cent close agreement, quadratic weighted Kappa, and the Bland and Altman limits of agreement. Outcomes &amp; Results: Per cent close agreement between the two environments was within a predetermined clinical criterion of 80% agreement for all voice and oromotor parameters, articulatory precision and speech intelligibility in conversation. Levels of agreement between the environments, based on quadratic weighted Kappa, ranged from poor to good for vocal parameters and from fair to very good for oromotor parameters. Bland and Altman limits of agreement analyses revealed comparability between online and face-to-face environments for vocal sound pressure level, phonation time, pitch range, sentence intelligibility and communication efficiency in reading. Intra- and inter-rater reliability scores for all tasks were comparable between the online and face-to-face environments. Conclusions &amp; Implications: For the majority of parameters, comparable levels of agreement were achieved between the two environments. Online assessment of disordered speech and voice in Parkinson's disease appears to be valid and reliable. The telerehabilitation application described in this study provides evidence for the delivery of online assessment for the dysarthric speech disorder associated with Parkinson's disease.</ab>

        <ab>Many of the estimated thirty-two million Americans expected to gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act are likely to have high levels of unmet need because of various chronic illnesses and to live in areas that are already underserved. In New Mexico an innovative new model of health care education and delivery known as Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) provides high-quality primary and specialty care to a comparable population. Using state-of-the-art telehealth technology and case-based learning, Project ECHO enables specialists at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center to partner with primary care clinicians in underserved areas to deliver complex specialty care to patients with hepatitis C, asthma, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, pediatric obesity, chronic pain, substance use disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular conditions, and mental illness. As of March 2011, 298 Project ECHO teams across New Mexico have collaborated on more than 10,000 specialty care consultations for hepatitis C and other chronic diseases.</ab>

        <ab>An unprecedented federal effort is under way to boost the adoption of electronic health records and spur innovation in health care delivery. We reviewed the recent literature on health information technology to determine its effect on outcomes, including quality, efficiency, and provider satisfaction. We found that 92 percent of the recent articles on health information technology reached conclusions that were positive overall. We also found that the benefits of the technology are beginning to emerge in smaller practices and organizations, as well as in large organizations that were early adopters. However, dissatisfaction with electronic health records among some providers remains a problem and a barrier to achieving the potential of health information technology. These realities highlight the need for studies that document the challenging aspects of implementing health information technology more specifically and how these challenges might be addressed.</ab>

        <ab>The Beacon Community Program, authorized under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), aims to demonstrate the potential for health information technology to enable local improvements in health care quality, cost efficiency, and population health. If successful, these communitywide efforts will yield important lessons that will assist other communities seeking to harness technology to achieve and sustain health care improvements. This paper highlights key programmatic details that reflect the meaningful use of technology in the fifteen Beacon communities. It describes the innovations they propose and provides insight into current and future challenges.</ab>

        <ab>Ultra-wideband (UWB) has potential applications in a variety of medical areas such as implant wireless sensors, microwave hyperthermia, imaging and radar. The wave propagation inside the human body must be known for an efficient system design of these different e-health applications. Nevertheless, little is known about the propagation of UWB signals inside the human body despite the enormous research efforts devoted to characterising radio propagation around the body. Therefore in this study, the UWB wave propagation through the human chest is characterised by electromagnetic simulations. For this sake, a voxel model of the human body that incorporates the frequency-dependent material properties of the human tissues is used. The wave propagation for line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios in the frequency bands of 100-1000 MHz and 1-5 GHz are evaluated. Both vertical and horizontal wave polarisations are considered. The power radiographs of the received signals inside the human chest are presented, which display the frequency and polarisation-dependent variations. The spectral analysis of the received signals reveals that the frequency range of 100-250 MHz, offers the minimum propagation loss. This frequency range of 250-1000 MHz is depicted as a region with less variant loss against frequency. Furthermore, the power delay profile (PDP) and the root mean square delay spread of the in-body channels is presented for different depths inside the body. These insightful results further the understanding of the propagation behaviour of UWB signals inside the human body, which will ease the development of in-body e-health applications.</ab>

        <ab>The potential for information technologies (ITs) to contribute to a struggle against social inequalities in health is discussed in contemporary policy and research. Expectations are on IT to facilitate access to health expertise and knowledge, and hence result in improved health practices and outcomes for individuals. In this article, the authors argue that this currently dominant understanding of the relation between IT and social inequalities in health is constraining as well as insufficient to explain the persistence of health inequalities in digitalized western societies. Human action is reduced to be about rational choice, and technology is expected to be a passive tool to be employed by implementers and policy-makers. Drawing on case studies from two telemedicine projects in Norway, this analysis combines perspectives from sociology concerned with structural inequalities on the one hand, with science technology studies on the other. It reveals how the practice and performance of IT is tied to the practice and performance of local differences, and this might be important to a discussion of the social distribution of health. Combining these two perspectives allows for an alternative understanding of how IT and social inequalities in health interact.</ab>

        <ab>Disease management programs, which use no advanced information and computer technology, are as effective as telemedicine but more efficient because less costly. We proposed a platform to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of home monitoring using data mining for early detection of any worsening in patient's condition. These worsenings could require more complex and expensive care if not recognized. In this letter, we briefly describe the remote health monitoring platform we designed and realized, which supports heart failure (HF) severity assessment offering functions of data mining based on the classification and regression tree method. The system developed achieved accuracy and a precision of 96.39% and 100.00% in detecting HF and of 79.31% and 82.35% in distinguishing severe versus mild HF, respectively. These preliminary results were achieved on public databases of signals to improve their reproducibility. Clinical trials involving local patients are still running and will require longer experimentation.</ab>

        <ab>This letter introduces MercuryLive, a platform to enable home monitoring of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors. MercuryLive contains three tiers: a resource-aware data collection engine that relies upon wearable sensors, web services for live streaming and storage of sensor data, and a web-based graphical user interface client with video conferencing capability. Besides, the platform has the capability of analyzing sensor (i.e., accelerometer) data to reliably estimate clinical scores capturing the severity of tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia. Testing results showed an average data latency of less than 400 ms and video latency of about 200 ms with video frame rate of about 13 frames/s when 800 kb/s of bandwidth were available and we used a 40% video compression, and data feature upload requiring 1 min of extra time following a 10 min interactive session. These results indicate that the proposed platform is suitable to monitor patients with PD to facilitate the titration of medications in the late stages of the disease.</ab>

        <ab>We present a simple, low-cost method for measuring multiple physiological parameters using a basic webcam. By applying independent component analysis on the color channels in video recordings, we extracted the blood volume pulse from the facial regions. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, and HR variability (HRV, an index for cardiac autonomic activity) were subsequently quantified and compared to corresponding measurements using Food and Drug Administration-approved sensors. High degrees of agreement were achieved between the measurements across all physiological parameters. This technology has significant potential for advancing personal health care and telemedicine.</ab>

        <ab>A major challenge for healthcare is how to provide improved services to an increasing number of people using limited financial and human resources. Pervasive healthcare is considered a solution to many existing problems and a possible future of the current healthcare services. In simple terms, pervasive healthcare can be defined as healthcare to anyone, anytime, and anywhere by removing locational, time and other restraints while increasing both its coverage and quality. The broad definition includes prevention, healthcare maintenance and checkups, short-term monitoring (or home healthcare monitoring), long-term monitoring (nursing home), personalized healthcare monitoring, incidence detection and management, and, emergency intervention, transportation and treatment. These requirements could be effectively supported by universal, efficient and reliable access to healthcare services, providers, and biomedical information that is available at any time. In this paper, several pervasive healthcare applications and related challenges are discussed. An integrated wireless architecture that is designed to use the capabilities of current and emerging wireless and mobile networks for location management, intelligent emergency system, patient monitoring, and mobile telemedicine applications is presented.</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the association between nursing home administrators (NHAs) professional membership, certification, and fellow status with quality indicators in nursing homes. Membership, certification, and fellow information (representing increasing levels of participation) originated from the American College of Health Care Administrators (ACHCA). ACHCA is a professional association which represents long-term care administrators. The Quality Measures reported on the Nursing Home Compare web-site, and facility information from the On-line Survey Certification of Automated Records (OSCAR) were used. The period of interest was 2010 and atotal of 19 quality indicators were examined. Data were analyzed through multivariate analyses using negative binomial regression. The results indicate NHAs who are members of ACHCA are associated with better quality in 6 of the 19 quality indicators examined; ACHCA certified member fellows are associated with better quality in 7 of the 19 quality indicators examined; ACHCA fellows are associated with better quality in 10 of the 19 quality indicators examined; and, ACHCA members (excluding certified, certified fellows, and fellows) are associated with better quality in 13 of the 19 quality indicators examined. These findings support the value of professional membership, as well as voluntary certification or fellow credentialing of NHAs with respect to quality improvement.</ab>

        <ab>Faced with a drop in the NASDAQ, four eHealth entrepreneurs must decide between two distribution strategies for their new company's technology. The team, comprised of three full-time resident physicians and an MBA, has developed software to enable electronic documentation and billing of medical and surgical procedures. The initial strategy was to distribute the technology through individual hospital intranets. Under pressure from venture capitalists and a "dot-com" frenzy in the market, the team starts to develop an "Internet portal" strategy, distributing the software over the Internet and adding traditional e-commerce services. When the stock market crashes in April 2000, the team must decide whether to push on with the Internet strategy or return to the intranet model. Throughout the case, a variety of new product development and team learning issues are explored: What is the optimal team composition? How quickly can the team overcome technical challenges? Who should their lead users be? How well do they understand the market? How quickly can they learn to work together, raise money, and build partnerships?</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the technological developments in the U.S. hospital industry. It cites as example the videoconferencing project launched by the Indianapolis, Indiana-based St. Vincent Health in a bid to keep its patients out of the hospital. It claims that the project was also introduced in other hospitals in the state with the support by the Central Indiana Beacon Community. The opinion of eHealth Initiative's Jennifer Covich on the developments is also cited.</ab>

        <ab>The contributions of the information science community to health care are significant, especially through systems supporting clinical care for individual patients, an intervention informatics approach. Though valuable, this strategy is reactive, fails to account for numerous environmental factors affecting personal health and falls short of enhancing human health on a broader scale. An unmet challenge with abundant opportunity lies in prevention informatics, a proactive approach drawing on information science and technologies to deliver greater health gains at a population level. Prevention informatics is marked by a high degree social interactivity in real time, with technologies to bring together disparate data and represent it in an integrated and meaningful way as the basis for action. The approach relies on standards for classifying information, systematic knowledge management and improved methods to collect, mine and visualize data. Tools and software are already in use in locations around the world, relying on smartphone technology and geographic information systems to share community health information and location data. Further advances in prevention informatics will require adoption of common terminologies, visualization tools and GIS mapping, and optimized data exchange to support rapid prevention response.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents several developments related to computing and Internet as of June 2000. According to a newsreport, the Supreme Court in the U.S. has opened its own Website, www.supremecourtsus.com . Many of the court's written decisions will be posted online, as well as upcoming cases, opinions, orders and arguments. The site makes it easier for public access to court opinions and hard-to-find information. In another development, according to journal USA Today, several major airlines are working on systems that will offer passengers electronic mail access as part of their in-flight services. The airborne electronic mail is sent to equipped planes via ground transmitters or satellites. Messages are sorted by an onboard server and routed to passengers. Another news included is that computerized fiber-optic laser device that can instantly identify cancerous cells is being developed by New Mexico-based Sandia National Laboratories and the University of New Mexico's medical school. This device would analyze protein density within a cell during biopsy procedures and will be able to determine the presence of cancer immediately.</ab>

        <ab>The article looks at the impact of technology on the healthcare sector and occupational health settings in Great Britain. A webcam and voice over internet protocol (IP) telephony can provide audio-visual connection in remote health consultations with patients. It says that one can determine the stress profile of a person by using a three-dimensional (3D) accelerometer and a heart-rate monitoring technology. It emphasizes the cost saving benefit of screen technology in both the private and public sectors if the right patients were selected for assessment.</ab>

        <ab>This article contributes to re-specifying a number of the phenomena of interest to organizational studies in terms of patterns of socio-material practices and their effects. It does so by outlining a vocabulary and strategy that make up a framework for theorizing work and organizational practices. The vocabulary is based on number of sensitizing concepts that connote practice as an open-ended, heterogeneous accomplishment which takes place within a specific horizon of sense and a set of concerns which the practice itself brings to bear. The strategy is based on the metaphorical movement of 'zooming in' and 'zooming out of' practice. The zooming in and out are obtained through switching theoretical lenses and re-positioning in the field, so that certain aspects of the practice are foregrounded while others are bracketed. Building on the results of an extended study of telemedicine, the article discusses in detail the different elements of the framework and how it enhances our capacity to re-present practice. The article concludes with some considerations on how the proposed approach can assist us in advancing the research agenda of organizational and work studies.</ab>

        <ab>The article examines issues surrounding the rural health care pilot program of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The aim of the program is to ensure affordable rates for telemedicine and health care instruction services. The creation of the program was made possible through the Telecommunications Act of 1996. According to many analysts, the program suffered from too many rules and regulations, limiting the number of eligible applicants.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the advantages of faster broadband communication systems. In health care, it links two hospitals with focus on asking health specialists what they want to know from telemedicine over high-speed broadband. Internet protocol television is way ahead from cable-based triple-play competitors. For movies, it provides postproduction houses with a secure, easy-to-use destination on the network allowing one or more companies to work on a movie at the same time.</ab>

        <ab>The use of electronic health (eHealth) technologies in healthcare improves the quality of health services furnished to patients. The application of these technologies helps physicians and other health professionals to pursue early detection of abnormal status on patients? health. Body sensor networks are a type of wireless sensor networks aimed to be deployed on persons in order to collect physiological parameters for healthcare monitoring purposes. These BSNs are composed by several small sensors placed along patient?s body, and capable to send (wirelessly) the collected health parameters to remote providers. BSNs need to operate every time and everywhere to transmit these important parameters to healthcare providers or automatic system to detect any anomaly in the patient health status. To provide this continuous monitoring of patients, it is mandatory to provide mobility support for the BSN so it can always be connected to some gateway to the Internet and therefore to back-end health providers. Several mechanisms with mobility support for mobile devices have been provided. However, the mobility support of a whole BSN has not been fully addressed. This article overviews available handover mechanisms used for wireless sensors mobility and proposes a new ubiquitous mobility approach for BSNs in healthcare. A case study with this new handover mechanism developed for a hospital infirmary is presented and highlights the gain of performances of the proposed solution.</ab>

        <ab>Portable biomedical instrumentation has become an important part of diagnostic and treatment instrumentation, including telemedicine applications. Low-voltage and low-power design tendencies prevail. Modern battery cell voltages in the range of 3-3.6 V require appropriate circuit solutions. A two-electrode biopotential amplifier design is presented, with a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), high input voltage tolerance and standard first-order high-pass characteristic. Most of these features are due to a high-gain first stage design. The circuit makes use of passive components of popular values and tolerances. Powered by a single 3V source, the amplifier tolerates ± 1 V common mode voltage, ±50 µA common mode current and 2 V input DC voltage, and its worst-case CMRR is 60 dB. The amplifier is intended for use in various applications, such as Holter-type monitors, defibrillators, ECG monitors, biotelemetry devices etc.</ab>

Primary care advocates are said to be optimistic that the rule will start the process of detaching primary care from a fee-for-service system that rewards volume over value.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that nurses in Great Britain have called on the Department of Health to reconsider replacing the National Health Service (NHS) Direct with the 111 service, arguing that the service run by call centre staff with no clinical training will put patients at risk of being misdirected.</ab>

        <ab>This article presents an outlook for the health care marketing industry in the U.S. With the start of a new century and a new millennium, the U.S. health care prognosticators are thriving. Some of these forecasters have examined the country's health care industry in the broadest terms, considering any factors that could be remotely related to health and health care. Others have been more focused, considering instead technological developments, financing options or some other dimension of health care. The health care system is expected to continue to face overcapacity in terms of physicians and hospital beds. Hospital admissions will remain low by historical standards with no relief provided by baby boomers for another 10 or so years. The hospital of the future will look much more like an ambulatory care center with some beds attached than it will a traditional hospital. Technology's impact will continue to be felt through the introduction of new pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Perhaps even greater impact will be seen in information technology, although this aspect has limited implications for marketing. Health care continues to lag behind other industries, and few if any health care organizations are prepared for the information demands of the twenty-first century.</ab>

        <ab>In this article the authors presented a market research study that examined how a health care service provider was better able to fulfill customers' needs through technological innovations. The potential customers did not fully embrace the technology itself, despite the improved communication flows, deadline fulfillments, and staff responsiveness. By linking the needs of the customers to the firm's advanced technology and services, strategic marketing and service quality delivery was achieved.</ab>

The program replaces NHS Direct which has supplied a nurse-led telephone sorting service for 12 years.

        <ab>The article focuses on the spectrum allocated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for medical body area networks (MBANs). MBANs are expected to reduce or remove the need for wires tethering a patient to a hospital bed. Wireless remote technologies are being used to monitor and collect physiological data from patients and companies have created sensor-based technologies for clinical settings. Companies such as GE Healthcare have petitioned the FCC to set aside the spectrum.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that some small, rural healthcare organizations in the U.S. are becoming health information technology front-runners. Two rural providers from West Virginia and another two from Louisiana have reportedly shown that size and geography need not create huge hurdles. All rural providers have qualified for federal electronic health record (EHR) incentive payments. They have also joined health information exchanges and utilized data from their systems.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the SGR, which was created by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act that links physician fees and costs to the U.S. gross domestic product. A 4.8% pay cut to physicians was produced by the provision in 2002 while the latest required cut is 24.4% that is set to be effective starting January 1, 2014. Representative Allyson Schwartz of Pennsylvania introduced a legislation that would replace the exiting system with an undetermined alternatives to the traditional one.  INSET: SLOW GROWING.</ab>

It mentions that the crisis costs providers in the country around 25 billion U.S. dollars. To improve the care transition, the federal government has implemented the Affordable Care Act that penalizes hospitals that will not reduce their readmission rates.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the introduction of a new version of Concord Communications Inc.'s eHealth Suite. The new eHealth Suite is an integrated tool for all-round performance management, visualization and analytics. It will include management of client-side Java applications on top of existing Internet and Windows applications, as well as on Microsoft Corp. Exchange2003 e-mail servers. According to officials, the suite uses a series of agents which monitors performance on servers and end stations, detects performance degradation and determines what's wrong, what's affected and how to resolve the problem. According to Henderson Jones, network analyst at the North-western Medical Faculty Foundation, in Chicago, the primary benefits to IT shops from tools such as eHealth Suite are faster troubleshooting of performance problems and the ability to quickly show business users what is happening. Concord has also simplified deployment of eHealth agents, which can monitor performance and generate synthetic transactions that mimic user behavior.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: In this paper, we present a lossy compression scheme based on the application of the 3D fast wavelet transform to code medical video. This type of video has special features, such as its representation in gray scale, its very few interframe variations, and the quality requirements of the reconstructed images. These characteristics as well as the social impact of the desired applications demand a design and implementation of coding schemes especially oriented to exploit them. We analyze different parameters of the codification process, such as the utilization of different wavelets functions, the number of steps the wavelet function is applied to, the way the thresholds are chosen, and the selected methods in the quantization and entropy encoder. In order to enhance our original encoder, we propose several improvements in the entropy encoder: 3D-conscious run-length, hexadecimal coding and the application of arithmetic coding instead of Huffman. Our coder achieves a good trade-off between compression ratio and quality of the reconstructed video. We have also compared our scheme with MPEG-2 and EZW, obtaining better compression ratios up to 119% and 46%, respectively for the same PSNR.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on the support given by New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson to information technology (IT) initiatives in the healthcare arena. According to Richardson, the lack of automation information can result to inefficiencies and errors. The New Mexico Telehealth Commission was created by Richardson in 2005 to address this deficiency. As of 2006, the state's clinics feature a Web-based electronic health record (EHR) and practice management (PM) system. Clinical workflow has improved in the state as a result of its digital transformation.</ab>

        <ab>This article present information on several reports and publications, related to medical care. Regionalization of Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response, a May 2004 evidence report from the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, concludes that regional response strategies may benefit some bioterrorism preparedness and response capabilities. However, the report cites research indicating that designated hospitals are not receiving enough compensation from their regional trauma care systems. Electronic Prescribing: Toward Maximum Value and Rapid Adoption, a April 2004 report from the eHealth Initiative, says that physicians' acceptance of electronic prescribing systems will require systems that are of proven value in safety and quality improvement; are quick to install and easy to learn or use; and come with financial incentives to overcome their cost of installation.</ab>

It uses publicly available radio spectrum and is compatible with Linux operating system. The use of the technology for the remote operations of hospitals is discussed.</ab>

        <ab>As the U.S. healthcare model changes from rewarding for quantity to rewarding for quality, disease management is projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments in the industry,with healthcare IT vendors scrambling for a piece of the proverbial pie.They really have their work cut out for them.According to a National Assessment of Adult Literacy survey, two in five American adults have difficulty processing health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. That's an estimated 90 million people, and those with poor health literacy also are more likely to have a chronic disease and less likely to get the healthcare they need.The survey goes on to state that 75 percent of Americans who reported having a long-term illness had limited health literacy and knew less about their conditions or how to handle symptoms. The need for awareness and adherence to health literacy principles has become a public health concern, estimated to cost the U.S. economy in the range of $106 billion to $238 billion annually, according to the survey."The widespread but often unrecognized public health challenge of health literacy serves as both a warning and a call to action," says Jack Harris, M.D., vice president of Eli Lilly and Company's U.S. medical division. "Overcoming health disparities is a transformational and important journey. At Lilly we are working to develop communication and health education that connects with patients in a way that's meaningful and understandable."If a chronic disease sufferer doesn't understand his or her diagnosis or treatment plan, it's easy to see how that lack of information could lead to recurring hospital readmittances for the same condition. As ve:ndon, hospitals and physician practices formulate their disease management plans, health literacy should be top of mind.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the function and activities of the Men's Health Forum as of June 2011. Defined as a charity which seeks to address men's health issues throughout Britain, it provides statistics which show that men in the country have shorter life spans and poorer health than women, and provides the reasons why. To address these issues, the forum offers technological solutions in the form of a web site which men can access anonymously, health pamphlets and kits disguised as car manuals and shaving kits, and programs at work.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the impact of an increase in Great Britain's aging population to public health reforms. By 2050, the British government expects the population of people aged 65 and over to increase by 252 percent. In relation to this statistics, the National Health Service (NHS) is urging reforms to be made in key policy areas including a proposal to pass over the commissioning budget to general practitioners (GP), consider enhanced support for self-care of people with chronic health conditions, and more collaboration with healthcare professionals.</ab>

        <ab>A proof-of-concept design of a patient monitoring solution for intensive care unit environments has been presented. It is end-to-end standard-based, using ISO/IEEE 11073 (X73) in the bedside environment and EN13606 to communicate the information to an electronic healthcare record (EHR) server. At the bedside end, the system is a plug-and-play sensor network communicating with a gateway that collects medical information and sends the data to a monitoring server. The monitoring server transforms this information into an EN13606 extract to be stored on the EHR server. The system has been implemented to comply with the last X73 and EN13606 available versions and tested in a laboratory environment to demonstrate the feasibility of an end-to-end standard-based solution.</ab>

        <ab>An ageing population is now the leading healthcare concern of many countries in the world. Aged patients need more healthcare efforts as they present more cases of chronic illnesses involving higher healthcare costs. e-Health systems based on modern information technology are expected to play a role in alleviating this problem. Fortunately, there have been dramatic advances in healthcare technology in terms of mobility, size, speed and communication. However, the main drawbacks of currently deployed e-Health monitoring systems originate from the fact that patients are ‘constrained’ within smart rooms and beds fitted with monitoring devices. Such monitoring is not ubiquitous in view of the privacy, mobility and flexibility issues concerning patients. On the other hand, health monitoring products strapped to the patient's body provide no analysis or recommendations of results. A multi-agent architecture for mobile health monitoring is presented, involving a team of intelligent agents that collate patient data, reason collectively and recommend actions to patients and medical staff in a mobile environment.</ab>

        <ab>The healthcare industry is being impacted by advances in information technology in four major ways:first, a broad spectrum of tasks that were previously done manually can now be performed by computers: second, some tasks can be outsourced to other countries using inexpensive communications technology: third, longitudinal and societal healthcare data can now be analyzed in acceptable periods of time; and fourth, the best medical expertise can sometimes be made available without the need to transport the patient to the doctor or vice versa. The healthcare industry will increasingly use a portfolio approach comprised of three closely-coordinated components seamlessly interwoven together: healthcare tasks performed by humans on-site: healthcare tasks performed by humans off-site, including tasks performed in other countries: and healthcare tasks performed by computers without direct human involvement. Finally, this paper deals with intellectual property and legal aspects related to the three-pronged healthcare services paradigm.</ab>

        <ab>Optic disc (OD) detection is a main step while developing automated screening systems for diabetic retinopathy. We present in this paper a method to automatically detect the position of the OD in digital retinal fundus images. The method starts by normalizing luminosity and contrast through out the image using illumination equalization and adaptive histogram equalization methods respectively. The OD detection algorithm is based on matching the expected directional pattern of the retinal blood vessels. Hence, a simple matched filter is proposed to roughly match the direction of the vessels at the OD vicinity. The retinal vessels are segmented using a simple and standard 2-D Gaussian matched filter. Consequently, a vessels direction map of the segmented retinal vessels is obtained using the same segmentation algorithm. The segmented vessels are then thinned, and filtered using local intensity, to represent finally the OD-center candidates. The difference between the proposed matched filter resized into four different sizes, and the vessels' directions at the surrounding area of each of the OD-center candidates is measured. The minimum difference provides an estimate of the OD-center coordinates. The proposed method was evaluated using a subset of the STARE project's dataset, containing 81 fundus images of both normal and diseased retinas, and initially used by literature OD detection methods. The OD-center was detected correctly in 80 out of the 81 images (98.77% ). In addition, the OD-center was detected correctly in all of the 40 images (100%) using the publicly available DRIVE dataset.</ab>

Telehealth reportedly enables providers, from their office or home, to follow up with their patients using live video, secure text chat and phone. Telehealth also improves care condition by allowing primary care providers to consult with clinical specialists in real time. In 2011, the global telemedicine market grew to 11.6 billion U.S. dollars, from 9.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2010.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports on the new upgrade of CA Inc. of its Unicenter product by introducing the Release 11.1 of its flagship network and systems management software (NSM). The launch of the Unicenter NSM r11.1 in the late 2005 explores the common management database (MDB), aiming to deliver higher level of integration of the company's Unicenter products. An example of its features is the integration of many product offerings sold as add-ons, thus it is faster to deploy. Moreover, the new product can deliver greater integration with the eHealth and Spectrum management products of CA.</ab>

        <ab>We describe the use of telemedicine by the Biobehavioral Service at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics to conduct brief functional analyses for children with developmental and behavioral disorders who live in rural areas of Iowa. Instead of being served at our outpatient facility, participants received initial behavioral assessments in their local schools or social service agencies via videoconference. Case descriptions for 2 participants whose evaluations were conducted via telemedicine, and a brief summary of all outpatient assessments conducted over a 4-year period by the Biobehavioral Service, are provided. This report extends previous applications of functional analysis procedures by examining brief behavioral assessments conducted via telemedicine.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses the implications of the planned approval by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of a proposal that will allocate spectrum for wireless patient monitoring technology. Such technology could enable patient monitoring at home instead of in the hospital. Such move could create a new market for companies developing the technology and even lower healthcare costs as well as keep elderly and chronically ill patients out of the hospital.  INSET: WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY?.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to report on use of the IEC80001 standard, Application of Risk Management for Information Technolody (IT) Networks Incorporating Medical Devices, to deploy a wireless alarm management solution in a long-term care home facility. Design/methodology/approach – The standard suggests the use of a unique responsibility matrix and a continuous quality improvement approach for analysis, evaluation and control of risks. A unique leadership committee and workgroup were formed to develop processes and procedures for integrating medical devices with IT systems; as well as execution of the project itself. The leadership committee oversaw the phased approach of assessing the technology, the clinical environment, proponent technology-based solutions and a specified risk management file. The project expanded its scope beyond the standard to include a risk focussed analysis of clinical workflow to evaluate the usability of the solution. Findings – The standard focussed approach identified numerous risks associated with the technical and network solution and the future state workflow. Medical devices proved to be the most limiting technology needing to be incorporated into the solution. Although faced with a daunting list of network related risks, it was concluded that all residual risks would have been acceptable. The analysis of the future state workflow identified various risks related to usability (human factors), battery management and the absence of additional operating dollars for supplementary staffing duties and new operational expenses. Originality/value – To the best of the authors knowledge, this paper is the first one to detail the process of following the IEC80001 standard in Canada. It offers insight into building an organizational framework around the standard and identifies gaps that should be considered by executive and project sponsors before proceeding with a project.</ab>

        <ab>The rapid growth of the biomedical engineering field presents researchers with both unique challenges and opportunities. At the same time, an increasing number of journals are in development by various publishers. A question that may arise is how we should distinguish TBME from the ever growing number of journals while maintaining the status of TBME as the leading platform for publications in biomedical engineering. It is argued that the mission of TBME should be to publish significant comprehensive research that integrates engineering with biomedicine. Topics shall include, but are not limited to, the following: biomedical signal processing, biomedical imaging and image processing, bioinstrumentation, biosensors, micro/ nanobiotechnology, bioinformatics and computational biology, biomedical modeling and computing, cardiovascular engineering, neural and rehabilitation engineering, cellular and tissue engineering and biomaterials, biomechanics, robotics, therapeutic and diagnostic systems, devices and technologies, clinical engineering, healthcare information systems and telemedicine, and emerging topics in biomedical engineering. Given this broad spectrum of topics within biomedical engineering, TBME should aim to be the journal to publish in the field of biomedical engineering. TBME should publish the highest quality scientific works that make significant advancements in conceptualization of the field of biomedical engineering. Incremental improvements in an existing research area should not be TBME's focus. To reach maximum impact, the presentations should be oriented at general readership in the biomedical engineering community.While mathematical proofs and formulas are essential for demonstrating theoretical concepts, only key equations central to the meaning of the work should be presented. Detailed derivation should be moved to the appendix or be submitted to more technically specialized journals.</ab>

        <ab>Mobile healthcare (m-health) is a new paradigm that brings together the evolution of emerging wireless communications and network technologies with the concept of `connected healthcare' anytime and anywhere. In this article, we present the performance analysis of an end-to-end mobile Tele-Echography using an ultra-Light robot (OTELO), over the third-generation (3G) mobile communications network. The experimental setup of the OTELO system over a 3G connectivity link used to measure the system performance is described. The performance of the relevant medical data and the relevant quality of service (QoS) issues defined in terms of the average throughput, delta-time packet delay, and jitter delay are investigated. The real-time 3G performance results show the successful operation of this bandwidth demanding robotic m-health system.</ab>

        <ab>The development of the wireless body area sensor network (BASN) is imperative for modern telemedicine and m-health, but security remains a formidable challenge yet to be resolved. As nodes of BASN are expected to be interconnected on or in the human body, the body itself can form an inherently secure communication pathway that is unavailable to all other kinds of wireless networks. This article explores the use of this conduit in the security mechanism of BASN; that is, by a biometrics approach that uses an intrinsic characteristic of the human body as the authentication identity or the means of securing the distribution of a cipher key to secure inter-BASN communications. The method was tested on 99 subjects with 838 segments of simultaneous recordings of electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram. By using the interpulse interval (IPI) as the biometric trait, the system achieved a minimum half total error rrate of 2.58 percent when the IPIs measured from signals, which were sampled at 1000 Hz, were coded into 128-bit binary sequences The study opens up a few key issues for future investigation, including compensation schemes for the asynchrony of different channels, coding schemes, and other suitable biometric traits.</ab>

        <ab>The growing percentage of elderly people in society calls for novel healthcare support services to enhance elders' daily life independence in indoor and outdoor environments. Ubiquitous technologies create significant opportunities not only for indoor, but also for outdoor anytime and anywhere assistance. However, outdoor emergency assistance requires that we address several challenging aspects, from elder location tracking and health condition monitoring to the formation of ad hoc assistance groups capable of assisting elders in need of help. This article focuses on the creation and management of outdoor assistance teams and proposes a group management system, AGAPE, that exploits visibility of location and group/user/device profile information as a key principle to trigger and control the team formation and team member interactions required to coordinate emergency activities.</ab>

        <ab>Microsoft Corp.'s leaders Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer have long believed that, and it's clear that in acquiring Rational Software a year ago, IBM believes it, too. By announcing last week plans for "Atlantic," the next generation of the Rational tools suite, IBM has taken a strong position versus Redmond in the next battle for the hearts and minds of developers, pitting the open-source based Eclipse environment and Unified Modeling Language 2.0 against Redmond's Visual Studio Team System. IBM fellow Grady Booch told Senior Writer Darryl K. Taft in an interview that Microsoft's closed approach will prove to be shortsighted. As networks expand relentlessly, network monitoring tools must expand to enable IT pros to manage them. But choosing among tools is often an apples-to-oranges comparison, as each has different strengths, weaknesses and pricing structures. In Labs, Senior Analyst Cameron Sturdevant compares BMC's Patrol Visualis 1.4, Concord Communications' eHealth Suite 5.6 and HP's OpenView Network Node Manager Advanced Edition 7.01. Sturdevant finds that HP's latest Network Node Manager benefits from years of Management Information Base development.</ab>

        <ab>In virtual environment (VE) applications, where virtual objects are presented in a see-through head-mounted display, virtual images must be continuously stabilized in space in response to user's head motion. Time delays in head-motion compensation cause virtual objects to "swim" around instead of being stable in space which results in misalignment errors when overlaying virtual and real objects. Visual update delays are a critical technical obstacle for implementing head-mounted displays in applications such as battlefield simulation/training, telerobotics, and telemedicine. Head motion is currently measurable by a head-mounted 6-degrees-of-freedom inertial measurement unit. However, even given this information, overall VE-system latencies cannot be reduced under about 25 ms. We present a novel approach to eliminating latencies, which is premised on the fact that myoelectric signals from a muscle precede its exertion of force, thereby limb or head acceleration. We thus suggest utilizing neck-muscles' myoelectric signals to anticipate head motion. We trained a neural network to map such signals onto equivalent time-advanced inertial outputs. The resulting network can achieve time advances of up to 70 ms.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that Micromuse Inc. has revamped its portal tools to give users added flexibility and security when handling different management systems for a variety of constituents. The San Francisco event-management company reworked its visualization product to consolidate different Web interfaces into a single portal and to provide single sign-on to a range of OSS tools, officials said. Netcool/Portal Version 2.0, part of the Netcool/Dashboards product family, includes several integration modules that allow it to easily present performance data from Hewlett-Packard Co.'s OpenView Network Node Manager, BMC Software Inc.'s Remedy Action Request System, Concord Communications Inc.'s eHealth and other management systems. The tool allows service providers to present performance data to a range of users, including network operations center technicians and account managers as well as enterprise users such as line-of-business managers and CIO. The portal server includes a Content Replacement System, a proxy function that makes data coming from a variety of sources appear to come from a single host or port.</ab>

        <ab>The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), created under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, aims to regulate measures affecting international trade in services-including health services such as health insurance, hospital services, telemedicine, and acquisition of medical treatment abroad. The agreement has been the subject of great controversy, for it may affect the freedom with which countries can change the shape of their domestic health care systems. We explain the rationale behind the agreement and discuss its scope. We also address the major controversies surrounding the GATS and their implications for the U.S. health care system.</ab>

        <ab>We systematically reviewed the health and social science literature on access to and use of information technologies by homeless persons by searching 5 bibliographic databases. Articles were included if they were in English, represented original research, appeared in peer-reviewed publications, and addressed our research questions. Sixteen articles met our inclusion criteria. We found that mobile phone ownership ranged from 44% to 62%; computer ownership, from 24% to 40%; computer access and use, from 47% to 55%; and Internet use, from 19% to 84%. Homeless persons used technologies for a range of purposes, some of which were health related. Many homeless persons had access to information technologies, suggesting possible health benefits to developing programs that link homeless persons to health care through mobile phones and the Internet.</ab>

        <ab>Although interactivity has become inexorably linked to personal computing and the Internet, other communication technologies provide interactive options, too. Many of these alternative technologies are complementary to Internet usage in that their reach includes populations that lack regular PC-based Internet access. Among the challenges facing these communication technologies is finding ideal combinations of entertainment and information features that can be applied to service and work needs in a sufficiently attractive manner so as to justify the considerable supply-side and consumer investment in infrastructure, software, and equipment. Understanding interactivity in entertainment potentially has additional value in helping explain barriers to adoption of nonentertainment interactive media, such as electronic shopping, telework, distance learning, telemedicine, and smart house technology.</ab>

        <ab>The article focuses on networked multimedia systems. Multimedia applications such as video-on-demand and remote control applications require audiovisual information and full force-feedback control with time-bounded processing and communications system support in order to be extended to telemedicine and other advanced distributed virtual-reality applications. Therefore, the primary goal of an underlying Networked Multimedia  System (NMS) for these applications is to provide quality of service guarantees in an end-to-end fashion. The article focuses on timing quality guarantees such as end-to-end delay and intermediate jitter guarantees. Timing quality guarantees imply that continuous and discrete media must be transmitted from senders to receivers within given time bounds. Furthermore, the provision of end-to-end timing guarantees implies that the integration of different services, mechanisms and policies must occur along the transmission path. This integration presents many challenges across all levels of a NMS.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that Concord Communications Inc. announced last week it would acquire competitor Aprisma Management Technologies Inc. in a $93 million deal set to close in the first quarter. Concord says by incorporating Aprisma's fault management technology into its performance management software, the company will be able to provide customers with a more complete management product from one vendor. Consolidation in the management market is inevitable. Customers want to deal with fewer vendors, and the company realized adding Aprisma would help it providing to customers best-of-breed performance and fault management capabilities. The companies plan later this year to integrate Concords network, systems and application performance management and reporting software (eHealth Suite) with Aprisma's Spectrum infrastructure and IT service assurance software. The combination could help Concord win accounts from competitors Lucent, Info-Vista, Micromuse, Quallaby and Smarts, and start competing against BMC Software Inc., Computer Associates.</ab>

        <ab>The authors utilized pragmatic discursive analysis to consider their empirical study of the introduction of an electronic patient record system within hospitals based in a large region of the National Health Service in England. Their aim was to gain insight into the interplay between discourse and change as mediated by technology by exploring how a politically driven programme of change was translated during the introduction of a computer system intended to provide an electronic patient record. They identified contrasting discourses, determined by situated professional practices and stakeholder expectations that framed alternate understandings of the proposed systems implementation and related change processes. Over time, these contrasting local discourses in turn became increasingly dissonant with the national change programme policy rhetoric as the systems software failed to deliver anticipated benefits. The authors’ work emphasizes the mediating effect of technology in discourses of change. Limitations in systems functionality and a related lack of discourses of success slowed social momentum. Consequently, local and political articulations of change began to fragment. The authors suggest that understandings of change are experienced through different interpretive frameworks and mediated through the materiality of technology, highlighting the possibility of many and alternate meanings within any change process, and the considerable challenges in the development and implementation of information technology in healthcare.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports on the benefits of the final rule released by the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) that streamline how hospitals credential and grant privileges to physicians and other practitioners who provide care through telemedicine to rural and critical-access hospitals. The regulation is expected to encourage and facilitate not only the use of telemedicine, but also the use of treatment organization long sought by federal health officials.</ab>

        <ab>With the increasing number senior citizens, E-health is targeted for home use with the special requirements of being usable in everyday life and low cost. A wireless sensor network application is proposed here for 24 hour constant monitoring without disturbing daily activities of elderly people and their caretakers. In the system proposed, both fixed and body (mobile) sensors are used. Since not every elder likes to have a sensor board attached to him/her, and in many cases, he/she may not carry the sensor; the home sensor network independently would have the ability to monitor the health status and living environment based on the multisensor data analysis and fusion. A mixed positioning algorithm is proposed to determine where the elderly person is. The purpose of the positioning is to help the system to determine the person?s activities and further to make decisions about his/her health status. The system could take care of two types of the basic needs of an elderly person: everyday needs as abnormal events and emergency alarms to doctors and caretakers through telephone, SMS and e-mail, and day to day requirements such as taking of medicine, having lunch, turn off the microwave oven, and so on. At same time, the system is sensitive to security and privacy issues.1</ab>

        <ab>This article reports that Computer Associates Inc. (CA) outlined a corporate reorganization designed in part to better focus the company on new opportunities in management software. The company then announced the 330 million-dollar buyout of Concord Communications (CC) Inc. CA, whose strength is systems and security management, says it is making the deal to add network management technologies to its portfolio. And the eHealth software of CC is used to monitor the performance of networks, including those that support voice over Internet protocol, wireless, and other applications.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that Aprisma Management Technology Inc. and Concord Communications Inc. have competed in a crowded network management market for years, albeit from two different directions: Concord worked to expand its business through acquisitions, while Aprisma struggled to win independence. Initially, Concord integrates its performance management software with technology from RiverSoft (which eventually was acquired by competitor Micromuse) to add fault management to its software suite in September 2001. Aprisma announces in January 2002 that it will spin off of Enterasys to form an independent company and focus on developing its management software product to work with heterogeneous network gear. Concord licensesTavve Software's EventWatch root cause technology to add discovery of Layer 2 and 3 network topology to Concord's eHealth Suite.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose Many countries around the world have been undertaking initiatives to promote the improvement of care for people with chronic diseases. The purpose of this article is to showcase some of the innovations developed in Spain, with emphasis on the societal burden of chronicity and the emergent challenge of polypathology. Methods The database of the Observatory of Innovative Practices on Complex Chronic Disease Management (known in Spanish as OPIMEC and available at www.opimec.org) was used to identify innovations in Spain. Those that met five requirements were selected for this article. The person in charge of each innovation selected was contacted and asked to provide further information. All data gathered were organized in a similar way to facilitate a better understanding. Findings Six out of 45 potentially eligible innovations were selected. The innovations are related to strategies, predictive tools, case management, home care and patient education. Conclusion The innovations showed in this article are breaking ground in the Spanish National Health System. They appear to be improving chronic disease management, while transforming current healthcare delivery models.</ab>

Some systems to be placed in operating rooms require an approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The electrical safety of the equipment should be certified by Underwriters Laboratories and the European Economic Community. AV designers and integrators should consider the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act when building a telemedicine system.</ab>

        <ab>Peachtree Healthcare has major IT infrastructure problems, and CEO Max Berndt is struggling to find the right fix. He can go with a single set of systems and applications that will provide consistency across Peachtree's facilities but may not give doctors enough flexibility. Or he can choose service-oriented architecture (SOA), a modular design that will allow Peachtree to standardize incrementally and selectively but poses certain risks as a newer technology. What should he do? Four experts comment on this fictional case study, authored by John P. Glaser, CIO for Partners HealthCare System. George C. Halvorson, the chairman and CEO of Kaiser Permanente, warns against using untested methodologies such as SOA in a health care environment, where lives are at stake. He says Peachtree's management must clarify its overall IT vision before devising a plan to achieve each of its objectives. Monte Ford, the chief information officer at American Airlines, says Peachtree can gradually replace its old systems with SOA. An incremental approach, he points out, would not only minimize risk but also enhance flexibility and control, and would allow IT to shift priorities along the way. Randy Heffner, a vice president at Forrester Research who focuses on technology architectures for computer-based business systems, thinks SOA's modular approach to business design would best meet Peachtree's need for flexibility. He says that Peachtree's CIO sees SOA as a new product category but should instead view it as a methodology. John A. Kastor, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, questions the goal of standardized care. He argues that it would be difficult to persuade doctors, many of whom are fiercely independent, to follow rigid patterns in their work.</ab>

        <ab>In many applications involving multiple criteria optimal decision making, users may often want to make a personal trade-off among all optimal solutions for selecting one object that fits best their personal needs. As a key feature, the skyline in a multidimensional space provides the minimum set of candidates for such purposes by removing all points not preferred by any (monotonic) utility/scoring functions; that is, the skyline removes all objects not preferred by any user no matter how their preferences vary. Driven by many recent applications with uncertain data, the probabilistic skyline model is proposed to retrieve uncertain objects based on skyline probabilities. Nevertheless, skyline probabilities cannot capture the preferences of monotonic utility functions. Motivated by this, in this article we propose a novel skyline operator, namely stochastic skylines. In the light of the expected utility principle, stochastic skylines guarantee to provide the minimum set of candidates to optimal solutions over a family of utility functions. We first propose the lskyline operator based on the lower orthant orders. lskyline guarantees to provide the minimum set of candidates to the optimal solutions for the family of monotonicmultiplicative utility functions. While lskyline works very effectively for the family of multiplicative functions, it may miss optimal solutions for other utility /scoring functions (e.g., linear functions). To resolve this, we also propose a general stochastic skyline operator, gskyline, based on the usual orders. gskyline provides the minimum candidate set to the optimal solutions for all monotonic functions. For the first time regarding the existing literature, we investigate the complexities of determining a stochastic order between two uncertain objects whose probability distributions are described discretely. We firstly show that determining the lower orthant order is NP-complete with respect to the dimensionality; consequently the problem of computing lskyline is NP-complete.We also show an interesting result as follows. While the usual order involves more complicated geometric forms than the lower orthant order, the usual order may be determined in polynomial time regarding all the inputs, including the dimensionality; this implies that gskyline can be computed in polynomial time. A general framework is developed for efficiently and effectively retrieving lskyline and gskyline from a set of uncertain objects, respectively, together with efficient and effective filtering techniques. Novel and efficient verification algorithms are developed to efficiently compute lskyline over multidimensional uncertain data, which run in polynomial time if the dimensionality is fixed, and to efficiently compute gskyline in polynomial time regarding all inputs. We also show, by theoretical analysis and experiments, that the sizes of lskyline and gskyline are both quite similar to that of conventional skyline over certain data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our techniques are efficient and scalable regarding both CPU and IO costs.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses women's lack of access to healthcare including gynecologic and obstetric care in rural areas. According to the article, women in rural areas have limited resources, physician shortages and no insurance, which make it difficult to address their health concerns. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) reportedly urged physicians to share clinical expertise, collaborate with rural health agencies and advocate for telemedicine.</ab>

        <ab>This section presents an update on issues related to medical care in the U.S. An analysis by the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Health Research Institute has found that the federal stimulus incentives for doctors and hospitals to implement interoperable electronic health records will not compensate overall costs. The 2009 Deloitte Survey of Health Care Consumers has found that consumers want to be digitally connected to their providers. The survey also found that consumers are concerned about privacy and security issues associated with digital connection.</ab>

        <ab>This article is the first in a series that explores the growth in the use of, and reliance on, information management systems in health and social care. Its aim is to help nurses understand how effective information management systems can improve their practice. Problems faced by nurses in the past, when they have been required to use these systems to record, store and retrieve information, tended to be generated by poor or inappropriate systems. The series offers examples of how the vital role that nurses play in increasingly information-intensive healthcare environments can be developed. This first article sets the scene and considers the health and social care information agenda in light of the Department of Health (2012) information strategy.  INSET: Staff-led changes bring improvements.</ab>

It focuses on the communications and information security applied to the secure large-scale telecommunications systems implemented in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. It highlights the seven-layer Open System Interconnect (OSI) model designed to show the system vulnerabilities with reference to security. Furthermore, a specific application in the telemedicine environment was also suggested and can be similar to general Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) incidents applications.</ab>

        <ab>The health care industry, traditionally known as a laggard in the information technology (IT) arena in the United States, has been emerging as a leader in adopting mobile and wireless technology. In an October 2004 study of wireless adoption in various vertical industries, market research firm IDC found that more than 80 percent of 34 health care organizations surveyed said they have deployed wireless LAN or plan to deploy one in the next 12 months. According to the 2005 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Leadership Survey, 79 percent of 253 health care executives responding to an online questionnaire said they will use wireless information systems in 2005. Within health care, some of the most popular uses of wireless technology include accessing and updating electronic medical records at patients' bedsides, matching bar-coded patient wristbands and medication packages to physician orders, and using wireless badges for voice communication.</ab>

        <ab>Research problem: Tutorials and user manuals are important forms of impersonal support for using software applications, including electronic medical records (EMRs). Differences between user- and vendor-generated documentation may indicate support needs, which are not sufficiently addressed by the official documentation, and reveal new elements that may inform the design of tutorials and user manuals. Research question: What are the differences between user-generated tutorials and manuals for an EMR and the official user manual from the software vendor? Literature review: Effective design of tutorials and user manuals requires careful packaging of information, balance between declarative and procedural texts, an action and task-oriented approach, support for error recognition and recovery, and effective use of visual elements. No previous research compared these elements between formal and informal documents. Methodology: We conducted a mixed-methods study. Seven tutorials and two manuals for an EMR were collected from three family health teams and compared with the official user manual from the software vendor. Documents were qualitatively analyzed using a framework analysis approach in relation to the principles of technical documentation described before. Subsets of the data were quantitatively analyzed using cross-tabulation to compare the types of error information and visual cues in screen captures between user- and vendor-generated manuals. Results and discussion: The user-developed tutorials and manuals differed from the vendor-developed manual in that they contained mostly procedural and not declarative information; were customized to the specific workflow, user roles, and patient characteristics; contained more error information related to work processes than software usage; and used explicit visual cues on screen captures to help users identify window elements. These findings imply that to support EMR implementation, tutorials and manuals need to be customized and adapted to specific organizational contexts and workflows. The main limitation of the study is its generalizability. Future research should address this limitation and may explore alternative approaches to software documentation, such as modular manuals or participatory design.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses research being done on whether cellular telephone use by clinicians improves safety. It references a study by Keith Ruskin et al published in the January 2006 issue of "Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia." The study surveyed more than 4,000 anesthesiologists and found that using mobile telephones in hospitals reduces errors because of more timely communication. The research also found that mobile telephones rarely cause electronic magnetic interference.</ab>

        <ab>The article looks at how technology can help older people who live independently at home. Several companies are developing new technologies intended to make it easier, less stressful and even healthier for older folks to continue living at home. Demand for such technologies could be enormous, since baby-boomers are on the cusp of retirement. MedivoxRx Technologies Inc. has developed "Rex," the talking pill bottle. Health Hero Network Inc. has developed the "Health Buddy", a dedicated computer that offers daily coaching for some forty-five health conditions. Living Independently, a firm based in New York, last year began selling a similar system, called QuietCare, which combines motion detectors with a secure website where customers can check activity. Will the elderly tolerate a barrage of devices monitoring and tracking them, revealing everything down to when they had breakfast or last had a cup of tea? Richard Jones, the boss of Lusora, responds with a question of his own: "What's a greater loss of privacy than moving out of your own house?"</ab>

        <ab>In this work, a novel method of cocitation analysis, coined “contextual cocitation analysis,” is introduced and described in comparison to traditional methods of cocitation analysis. Equations for quantifying contextual cocitation strength are introduced and their implications explored using theoretical examples alongside the application of contextual cocitation to a series of BioMed Central publications and their cited resources. Based on this work, the implications of contextual cocitation for understanding the granularity of the relationships created between cited published research and methods for its analysis are discussed. Future applications and improvements of this work, including its extended application to the published research of multiple disciplines, are then presented with rationales for their inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that the U.S. Senate has voted $695 million to fund various rural telecom loan programs. This is part of a $100 billion fiscal year 2006 Department of Agriculture, rural development, Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies' appropriations bill. The Senate version of the bill, which passed on a 97-2 vote, also would appropriate $550 million for broadband telecom loans and $35 million for grants to support telemedicine and distance learning services in rural areas, with $10 million of the latter amount set aside for converting analog broadcast operations of rural noncommercial educational TV stations to digital operations.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: To analyse the impact of the observed increase in the prevalence in polypharmacy on the development of prescribed drug expenditure (PDE) in a national population during five years. Methods: A register-based study of all prescribed drugs and PDE for the entire Swedish population during a 3-month period in 2005 and 2009, respectively. The prevalence of “polypharmacy” and “excessive polypharmacy” was defined as the proportion of patients receiving five or more (PD≥5) and ten or more (PD≥10) prescribed drugs during a 3-month period, respectively. Results: Between 2005 and 2009, the prevalence of polypharmacy increased by 8.3% (from 11.1% to 12.0%), and the prevalence of excessive polypharmacy by 9.9% (from 2.4% to 2.6%). Total PDE increased by 4.8% in real prices. For the group of patients with polypharmacy and excessive polypharmacy, PDE increased by 6.2%, and 7.3%, respectively. A simulation, in which the increase in polypharmacy was neutralised, resulted in no increase in total PDE. Conclusions: The increase in the prevalence of polypharmacy has a substantial impact on the increase in PDE and can explain the entire increase in PDE in Sweden during 2005 to 2009. For clinicians and healthcare stakeholders, it is important to monitor and guidance the further development in multiple medication therapy, so that the cost associated with increasing polypharmacy will not exceed its benefits.</ab>

        <ab>This article provides information on the acquisition of Aprisma from Gore Technologies by Concord Communications in January 2005. Concord Communications placed itself among new competitors when it acquired Aprisma, maker of the Spectrum enterprise management platform. The combination of Concord's reporting technologies and the Aprisma platform could give BMC Software, Computer Associates, Hewlett-Packard (HP), IBM and other platform vendors a stiff competitor.  Spectrum, a network fault-management system developed by Cabletron in the early 1990s, relies on a fault-correlation engine. Concord offers strong performance monitoring and, with Spectrum, will be able to gather metrics from just about every aspect of delivery in a networked application. The two companies should work well together. Their product lines do not overlap, and their combined customer base will be about 4,000. The winners will be enterprises using systems from both, especially when Concord adapts its eHealth software to incorporate Spectrum's correlation capabilities. Over the long haul, Concord will compete with HP, IBM and others in the business-service management sector, which requires both a platform and monitoring.</ab>

        <ab>This study examined the use of different narratives expressing positive or negative emotions, and varying the narrator's perspective on the arousal of discrete emotions, dominant cognitions, perceived evidence quality, and perceived message effectiveness related to osteoporosis behavioral intentions. Formative research led to the creation of narratives and selection of positive and negative emotions expressed. A 4 × 3 between-subjects posttest design revealed positive relationships between judgments of evidence quality and perceptions of message effectiveness for predicting behavioral intentions toward osteoporosis prevention. In addition, arousing the emotions of fear and/or hope cued processing of osteoporosis narratives. The theoretical implications of these findings for the use of narratives as evidence and the application of findings for osteoporosis health messages are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Introduction: Clinical guidelines are advocated to improve the quality of care, especially for chronic diseases. However, the regulatory basis of clinical guidelines, their development, quality control, implementation and use as well as evaluation within countries across the European Union is not systematically known. Methods: Using information collected from key informants in each country by means of a structured questionnaire, this mapping exercise illustrates the varied status of guideline production in European Union countries. Results: Most European Union countries have an established national, regional or local clinical guideline programme, and a substantial proportion have developed guidelines on the prevention and management of chronic diseases. Several countries have mechanisms in place to ensure the quality of scientific evidence used for the development of guidelines is high and that the process is consistent and transparent. Others are only now taking an interest in guideline development and are taking the first steps towards establishing ways of implementing them. The majority of countries have no legal basis for the development of guidelines and those that have well established systems mostly implement them on a voluntary basis. The process of guideline development varies in its degrees of decentralisation across countries with many different types of organisations taking on this responsibility. There is general acceptance of the value of the instrument developed by the AGREE collaboration for evaluating the methodological robustness of guidelines. However, the extent to which guidelines are implemented in Europe is unknown, as there is no systematic data collection and, in most countries, no structure to enable it. There are few examples of formal evaluations of the development, quality, implementation and use of guidelines. Conclusions: Our findings call for renewed efforts to respond to the severe lack of standardized guideline terminology and accessibility as well as rigorous studies to evaluate the relationship between different ways to develop guidelines and their methodological quality, between their quality and the actual implementation and usage, and finally between implementation and health outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>According to a study conducted by the eHealth Initiative group, wholesale adoption of electronic prescribing could save the U.S. healthcare system 29 billion dollars a year. The authors of the study concluded though, that while employers and society may reap rewards, physicians do not have much incentive to give up their pens and paper prescription pads. An examination of public and private incentives led the group to focus on four areas with the most promise: reimbursement for using electronic prescribing or the information processed; pay for performance programs; third-party incentives from payers, pharmacies, or transaction brokers; and legislation.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on the use of patient biometrics in accessing electronic health records. Access, ownership and privacy of medical records are fundamental to the success of any real-world telemedicine application. It is further suggested that rather than use digit identifiers, patient biometrics would provide a much better access mechanism, in other words comparing freshly captured biometric identifiers with those stored on the smart device. Experiences gained from a field trial involving the use of USB iKeys for remote access of diabetes patient records are reported upon, and recommendations made for the future adoption of such systems.</ab>

        <ab>This article presents a comparative study of organisational and individual resistance to implementation of e-health technology in France, South Korea, Italy, Great Britain, and the U.S. Qualitative research has yielded organisational, structural and cultural dimensions related to uncertainty avoidance which may explain some of the variance in utilisation rates. Cross-national studies of e-health utilisation and cultural levels of uncertainty avoidance supply evidence of the role this dimension of culture may play in effective e-health implementations.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents a study that evaluates the efficacy of pharmacist-led, information technology-based intervention for medication errors (PINCER) in reducing the patients at risk because of hazardous prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDSs). The study is undertaken through a cluster randomized trial of pharmaceutical practices in Great Britain. The results of the study revealed that the PINCER intervention is an effective method in lessening the prescription errors.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports that sizable videogame hardware and software markets have laid the groundwork for such non-gaming applications as professional training, therapy and education. Like the razor blade market, software sales exceed console sales. Next-generation consoles from Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony will include more powerful central and graphics processors. The skills needed to defeat Bowser are similar to those required of laparoscopic surgeons, contends Dr. James "Butch" Rosser, developer of a videogame for surgical trainees. A study by Beth Israel Medical Center and the U.S. Department of Defense's Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center found that surgeons who play videogames before surgery have 37 percent fewer errors and complete surgeries 27 percent faster.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports on the planned partnership between Intel Corp. and General Electric Co. (GE) in the health care industry in the U.S. The plans of the companies to deliver health-care related technology will be discussed in a press conference in New York hosted by Intel chief executive officer (CEO) Paul Otellini and GE chief Jeffrey Immelt. Information technology (IT) was less than 10% of the business of GE Healthcare, according to CEO John Dineen. It is said that the focus of the U.S. administration in telemedicine places Intel in a good position.</ab>

        <ab>The article reports on the nine-month imprisonment of telemedicine Colorado doctor Christian Hageseth for his unlicensed practice in California. It notes that Hageseth had prescribed a 19-year-old patient outside his licensed state which had led to her suicidal death. American Telemedicine Association President Dale Alverson remarks that his imprisonment was not due to his prescription through the phone but from his licensure and credentials as a doctor.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Objectives: To analyse the acquisition cost of dispensed prescription drugs for individuals with multiple medications in a national population. Methods: We collected and analysed individual based data regarding the acquisition cost of dispensed prescription drugs for all individuals with five or more dispensed drugs (DP≥5) in Sweden 2006 (2.2 million). Results: Individuals with DP≥5 (24.5% of the population) accounted for 78.8% of the total acquisition cost, and individuals with DP≥10 (8.6% of the population) and DP≥15 (3.0% of the population) accounted for 46.3% and 23.2%, respectively. The average acquisition cost per defined daily doses (DDD) generally decreased with increasing age. The highest average cost per DDD was observed for individuals with DP≥10. The acquisition cost for women with DP≥5 represented 56.0% of the total acquisition cost. Men with DP≥5 represented 44.0% of the total acquisition cost. Conclusions: In an entire national population, individuals with multiple medication accounted for four fifths of the total acquisition cost of dispensed drugs. Actions to reduce the number of prescription drugs for the group of patients with a number of different drugs may also result in a substantial reduction of the total acquisition cost.</ab>

        <ab>One overall objective of Electronic Patient Records (EPRs) is to improve patient education and to enhance the patient experience through the use of information technology (IT) so as to facilitate the sharing of information between providers and their patients. The research project reported on herein took place at University Health Network (UHN) in Toronto (Canada), which is a large academic health science center with multiple hospital sites in the city. As a first step in this process, we examined the literature to investigate the human factors issues related to healthcare as well as other settings. Subsequently, we interviewed a number of interested stakeholders from two groups: the physicians (both family and attending) and the patients themselves. Finally, using a simulation environment, we explored the content that UHN lung-transplant patients would be interested in having within their own EPRs. In this paper, we report on the research, the methodology and the findings pertaining to the both the content and the design of an electronic patient record.</ab>

        <ab>E-health (information and communication technology that facilitates health and health care) is expanding in developed, developing, and least-developed countries. E-health's ability to transcend sociopolitical boundaries holds the potential to create a borderless world for health systems and health care delivery. But the policy needed to guide e-health development is limited and just now emerging in developed countries. What's needed to foster e-health growth in the developing world is thoughtful policy to facilitate patient mobility and data exchange, across both international borders and regional boundaries within countries.</ab>

        <ab>In 1986, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was identified in the UK. Millions of BSE-infected cows were slaughtered and over 150 people contracted variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an inevitably fatal human form of BSE. Tragic incidents such as this provide valuable opportunities to understand and improve the safety of complex socio-technical systems. By studying accidents, knowledge can be gained that can improve system safety. The purpose of this article is to test the usefulness of Rasmussen's risk management framework for explaining how and why accidents occur in the food production domain. This was accomplished by using the framework to retrospectively investigate how and why BSE was transmitted through the human and animal food supply in the UK from 1986 to 1996. More specifically, an AcciMap and Conflict Map were constructed to represent contributing factors of the epidemic according to the structure of Rasmussen's framework. These factors were used to test the seven predictions made by the framework. All seven predictions were supported by the evidence, indicating that Rasmussen's risk management framework shows promise as a theoretically driven explanation of how and why accidents happen in complex socio-technical systems, particularly in the food production domain.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents information on progress in health information technology (IT). It presents two different but complementary perspectives on achieving a necessary step forward for the U.S. healthcare system, moving off paper and into the digital age. The vision for the optimal integration of health IT into clinical practice should certainly be bold. Almost 50 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. Many emergency departments are so overcrowded that the average wait lime is longer than a cross-country flight.</ab>

        <ab>The article presents the author's opinion on why the offspring of technology experts planned to avoid careers in technology. Yes, technology work can be hard. But it can also be fun and rewarding. It most certainly will shape the future of the economic growth of the U.S. There is a tremendous upside to technology work in the U.S. Because there still remains another 58 years until Zefram Cochrane, an eccentric, fictional scientist, invents warp drive technology. Cochrane takes the first warp trip of the Earth from the movie Star Trek: First Contact. One positive legacy from the irrational, exuberant years of the late 1990s was the can do attitude of entrepreneurs, which held that dreams rather than customers drove business plans. While we know that cold cash won out over innovative ideas, we must return to optimism when it comes to the possibilities of technology. The past 10 years have been an era in which people and businesses got on the Internet. The next ten years will be an era marked by what people and businesses do on the Internet. While I do not expect technology experts in the U.S. will invent warp drive travel by 2015, I am optimistic that contributions from engineers in the U.S. will, for example, make an economy powered by hydrogen a possibility by then. And that is just one field. The possibilities in commerce, telemedicine and education are countless. Let us work together to get this industry and its career pipeline up to warp speed.</ab>

        <ab>Although the vast majority of U.S. physicians still handwrite prescriptions, adoption of electronic prescribing is slowly growing. Major barriers to adoption remain, including the inability to electronically submit prescriptions for controlled substances and confusion about standards for data exchange. Federal and state governments and private insurers are using payment and policy incentives to boost e-prescribing because they still believe in its promise for improving the quality and efficiency of health care. However, additional efforts and further investments are needed to reap the benefits of e-prescribing on a national scale.</ab>
